```

=== Interaction 4 ===
Response:
```DIALOGUE
Since we've successfully loaded the CIFAR-10 dataset, would you like me to proceed with adding basic preprocessing steps like normalization and data augmentation that would be beneficial for edge device training? I can keep it simple with just mean/std normalization and basic horizontal flipping as augmentation.
```
