```DIALOGUE
Let's brainstorm an innovative experiment building on these papers. I notice several works focus on NAS and compression for edge devices, but none combine dynamic architecture adaptation with real-time power monitoring. How about we design a system that dynamically adjusts model architecture (pruning level/quantization) based on current power constraints? We could use a lightweight RL agent to make these decisions in real-time. What do you think would be a good simple experiment to validate this concept?

```PLAN
Innovative Experiment Plan: "Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching for Edge Devices"

Objective: Develop a system that dynamically switches between different optimized neural architectures (searched via NAS) based on real-time resource constraints (power, latency, memory).

Key Components:
1. Model Zoo: Pre-train 3 NAS-optimized architectures from DCA-NAS paper (small, medium, large) on CIFAR-10
2. Switching Controller: Lightweight LSTM-based decision network that takes as input:
   - Current battery level (from device sensors)
   - Available memory
   - Required latency (from application)
3. Edge Platform: Raspberry Pi 4 with power monitoring circuitry

Experiment Design:
1. Dataset: CIFAR-10 with synthetic noise (to test denoising capability)
2. Baseline: Static NAS-optimized model (medium size)
3. Metrics: 
   - Accuracy vs power consumption
   - Switching overhead
   - Denoising quality (PSNR) when applicable

Implementation Steps:
1. Use DCA-NAS to generate 3 architectures targeting different resource profiles
2. Train switching controller via RL using battery/power simulations
3. Deploy on Raspberry Pi with real power monitoring
4. Compare against static models across different power scenarios

Expected Innovation: First system to dynamically switch complete architectures (not just pruning levels) based on real-time edge device constraints, combining benefits of NAS and dynamic adaptation.
