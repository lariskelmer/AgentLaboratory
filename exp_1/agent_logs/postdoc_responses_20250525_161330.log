```DIALOGUE
Let's brainstorm a novel approach building on these papers. I notice most works focus on either NAS or model compression separately. What if we combine them with a new twist - using NAS to optimize not just architecture but also compression parameters (pruning ratios, quantization bits) jointly? We could call this "Compression-Aware Neural Architecture Search" (CA-NAS). What do you think about this direction for edge image classification?
