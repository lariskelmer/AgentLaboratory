('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The method is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is required.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The method incorporates weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key innovations include a differentiable hardware-aware objective function that directly optimizes for device constraints like FLOPs and memory usage without requiring tunable scaling factors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains stable performance across different resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that balances computation allocation with practical latency considerations through a novel latency prediction model. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity and scheduling strategies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-world deployment scenarios. The latency predictor considers algorithm design, scheduling, and hardware properties to guide network optimization, making it particularly effective for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the critical rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with adjustable residual blocks that can scale to different edge device capabilities while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include a single-stage training strategy that outperforms previous two-stage approaches, and an 8\xd7 downsampling scheme that reduces encoding latency by 51.4% while improving accuracy by 0.93%. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression methods, with particular advantages at lower bit rates. The system achieves this through optimized network design choices including patch embedding layers and GeLU activations, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments where computational efficiency is crucial.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper introduces an optimized spiking neuron model for efficient image classification on edge devices through temporal coding with just two spikes per neuron. The authors propose a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion method called FS-conversion that significantly improves upon traditional rate-based approaches by encoding information in spike timing rather than just spike counts. Key innovations include: 1) A modified spiking neuron model (FS-neuron) with optimized internal dynamics for emulating ANN activation functions with minimal spikes, 2) Demonstration on ImageNet and CIFAR10 showing near-identical accuracy to original ANNs (83.57% on ImageNet with EfficientNet-B7) while using only ~2 spikes per neuron, 3) Substantial improvements in latency and throughput compared to rate-based conversions, enabling new image classification every 32 time steps. The method is particularly effective for edge deployment as it achieves biological-level energy efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications.\\narXiv ID: 1911.06777v1, Summary: This paper presents TinyCNN, a framework for designing CNN accelerators on embedded FPGAs for image classification. The framework provides automated hardware generation from a software-designed CNN, with three key components: (1) a Python-based software backend for CNN design/training, (2) a CHISEL-based hardware generator, and (3) a precision adjustment backend. The system uses 16-bit fixed-point data, achieving only 3% accuracy loss compared to 32-bit floating-point while providing up to 15.75x speedup on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. The framework addresses resource constraints through configurable convolution units (shared or exclusive modes), inter-layer precision adjustment, and automatic hardware resource checking. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show the FPGA implementation achieves 62.28% accuracy (vs 65.54% software) with 2.7ms inference time (vs 42.54ms on ARM CPU). The work demonstrates effective FPGA acceleration for CNNs while maintaining accuracy through precision optimization techniques.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework for optimizing deep learning models for edge devices. The method incorporates hardware constraints (memory and FLOPs) directly into the NAS objective function through a constrained optimization formulation. Key innovations include: 1) A differentiable resource constraint using a Lagrange multiplier, 2) Weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS), and 3) A lookup graph mechanism to handle differences between search and evaluation architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach achieves 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 3.4M parameters, and maintains performance when transferred across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with just one transformer encoder layer. Experiments across image classification, audio classification, and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPS compared to CNN-based approaches. The paper also presents a novel fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further enhances performance. Key results show SL-ViT branches outperform CNN counterparts in 26 out of 27 tested scenarios while reducing computational costs, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices requiring dynamic inference capabilities.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on image classification tasks. Key findings include: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy, 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop, 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time on edge devices, validating effectiveness for real-world deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a hardware-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs.

Please load CIFAR-10 from HuggingFace and apply minimal preprocessing: resize to 224x224 (standard for ImageNet-style models) and normalize with mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The method is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is required.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The method incorporates weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key innovations include a differentiable hardware-aware objective function that directly optimizes for device constraints like FLOPs and memory usage without requiring tunable scaling factors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains stable performance across different resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that balances computation allocation with practical latency considerations through a novel latency prediction model. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity and scheduling strategies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-world deployment scenarios. The latency predictor considers algorithm design, scheduling, and hardware properties to guide network optimization, making it particularly effective for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the critical rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with adjustable residual blocks that can scale to different edge device capabilities while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include a single-stage training strategy that outperforms previous two-stage approaches, and an 8\xd7 downsampling scheme that reduces encoding latency by 51.4% while improving accuracy by 0.93%. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression methods, with particular advantages at lower bit rates. The system achieves this through optimized network design choices including patch embedding layers and GeLU activations, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments where computational efficiency is crucial.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper introduces an optimized spiking neuron model for efficient image classification on edge devices through temporal coding with just two spikes per neuron. The authors propose a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion method called FS-conversion that significantly improves upon traditional rate-based approaches by encoding information in spike timing rather than just spike counts. Key innovations include: 1) A modified spiking neuron model (FS-neuron) with optimized internal dynamics for emulating ANN activation functions with minimal spikes, 2) Demonstration on ImageNet and CIFAR10 showing near-identical accuracy to original ANNs (83.57% on ImageNet with EfficientNet-B7) while using only ~2 spikes per neuron, 3) Substantial improvements in latency and throughput compared to rate-based conversions, enabling new image classification every 32 time steps. The method is particularly effective for edge deployment as it achieves biological-level energy efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications.\\narXiv ID: 1911.06777v1, Summary: This paper presents TinyCNN, a framework for designing CNN accelerators on embedded FPGAs for image classification. The framework provides automated hardware generation from a software-designed CNN, with three key components: (1) a Python-based software backend for CNN design/training, (2) a CHISEL-based hardware generator, and (3) a precision adjustment backend. The system uses 16-bit fixed-point data, achieving only 3% accuracy loss compared to 32-bit floating-point while providing up to 15.75x speedup on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. The framework addresses resource constraints through configurable convolution units (shared or exclusive modes), inter-layer precision adjustment, and automatic hardware resource checking. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show the FPGA implementation achieves 62.28% accuracy (vs 65.54% software) with 2.7ms inference time (vs 42.54ms on ARM CPU). The work demonstrates effective FPGA acceleration for CNNs while maintaining accuracy through precision optimization techniques.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework for optimizing deep learning models for edge devices. The method incorporates hardware constraints (memory and FLOPs) directly into the NAS objective function through a constrained optimization formulation. Key innovations include: 1) A differentiable resource constraint using a Lagrange multiplier, 2) Weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS), and 3) A lookup graph mechanism to handle differences between search and evaluation architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach achieves 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 3.4M parameters, and maintains performance when transferred across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with just one transformer encoder layer. Experiments across image classification, audio classification, and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPS compared to CNN-based approaches. The paper also presents a novel fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further enhances performance. Key results show SL-ViT branches outperform CNN counterparts in 26 out of 27 tested scenarios while reducing computational costs, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices requiring dynamic inference capabilities.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on image classification tasks. Key findings include: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy, 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop, 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time on edge devices, validating effectiveness for real-world deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a hardware-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs. Key innovations include: 1) A differentiable constrained optimization formulation that directly incorporates device resource constraints, 2) Weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods, 3) Demonstrated effectiveness on image classification tasks (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) where it achieves comparable accuracy to manual architectures with 10-15x smaller models. The method discovers Pareto-optimal architectures for given hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Dynamic Spike-Adaptive Pruning" (DSAP) - A novel technique that combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks (from FS-neuron paper) with dynamic structured pruning (from OTOV3) to create a model that automatically adjusts its active pathways based on both input complexity and real-time power constraints.\\n\\nExperiment Details:\\n1.

Let's modify our approach to handle the memory issue. Instead of applying transforms to the entire dataset at once, let's use a DataLoader with the transforms applied on-the-fly during batch loading.

Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains stable performance across different resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that balances computation allocation with practical latency considerations through a novel latency prediction model. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity and scheduling strategies, demonstrating significant improvements in real-world deployment scenarios. The latency predictor considers algorithm design, scheduling, and hardware properties to guide network optimization, making it particularly effective for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the critical rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with adjustable residual blocks that can scale to different edge device capabilities while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include a single-stage training strategy that outperforms previous two-stage approaches, and an 8\xd7 downsampling scheme that reduces encoding latency by 51.4% while improving accuracy by 0.93%. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression methods, with particular advantages at lower bit rates. The system achieves this through optimized network design choices including patch embedding layers and GeLU activations, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments where computational efficiency is crucial.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper introduces an optimized spiking neuron model for efficient image classification on edge devices through temporal coding with just two spikes per neuron. The authors propose a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion method called FS-conversion that significantly improves upon traditional rate-based approaches by encoding information in spike timing rather than just spike counts. Key innovations include: 1) A modified spiking neuron model (FS-neuron) with optimized internal dynamics for emulating ANN activation functions with minimal spikes, 2) Demonstration on ImageNet and CIFAR10 showing near-identical accuracy to original ANNs (83.57% on ImageNet with EfficientNet-B7) while using only ~2 spikes per neuron, 3) Substantial improvements in latency and throughput compared to rate-based conversions, enabling new image classification every 32 time steps. The method is particularly effective for edge deployment as it achieves biological-level energy efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications.\\narXiv ID: 1911.06777v1, Summary: This paper presents TinyCNN, a framework for designing CNN accelerators on embedded FPGAs for image classification. The framework provides automated hardware generation from a software-designed CNN, with three key components: (1) a Python-based software backend for CNN design/training, (2) a CHISEL-based hardware generator, and (3) a precision adjustment backend. The system uses 16-bit fixed-point data, achieving only 3% accuracy loss compared to 32-bit floating-point while providing up to 15.75x speedup on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA. The framework addresses resource constraints through configurable convolution units (shared or exclusive modes), inter-layer precision adjustment, and automatic hardware resource checking. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show the FPGA implementation achieves 62.28% accuracy (vs 65.54% software) with 2.7ms inference time (vs 42.54ms on ARM CPU). The work demonstrates effective FPGA acceleration for CNNs while maintaining accuracy through precision optimization techniques.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework for optimizing deep learning models for edge devices. The method incorporates hardware constraints (memory and FLOPs) directly into the NAS objective function through a constrained optimization formulation. Key innovations include: 1) A differentiable resource constraint using a Lagrange multiplier, 2) Weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS), and 3) A lookup graph mechanism to handle differences between search and evaluation architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach achieves 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 3.4M parameters, and maintains performance when transferred across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with just one transformer encoder layer. Experiments across image classification, audio classification, and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPS compared to CNN-based approaches. The paper also presents a novel fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further enhances performance. Key results show SL-ViT branches outperform CNN counterparts in 26 out of 27 tested scenarios while reducing computational costs, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices requiring dynamic inference capabilities.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on image classification tasks. Key findings include: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy, 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop, 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time on edge devices, validating effectiveness for real-world deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a hardware-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs. Key innovations include: 1) A differentiable constrained optimization formulation that directly incorporates device resource constraints, 2) Weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods, 3) Demonstrated effectiveness on image classification tasks (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) where it achieves comparable accuracy to manual architectures with 10-15x smaller models.

The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, modified Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6dB PSNR for denoising and 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet100 while meeting real-time latency constraints (13.7ms). The integrated approach demonstrates better denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on the trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms). The system demonstrates superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and learned feature compression methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that discovers Pareto-optimal architectures while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods. Experimental results show DCA-NAS achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models (97.2% on CIFAR-10, 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet) while being 15x smaller than manual architectures. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-time edge applications by discovering models with lower inference latency (shown on Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) through novel techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity (4x4 to 28x28 patches) and implementing operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in practical efficiency for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. The key innovation is a differentiable masking approach that jointly optimizes three critical architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (heart-rate monitoring, arrhythmia detection, hand-gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) demonstrate significant improvements: up to 152x parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy, and 5.5x/3.8x reductions in latency/energy on two different edge platforms (GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU) compared to hand-tuned models. The method achieves these results with search complexity comparable to a single training run, making it practical for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key innovations include: 1) A novel architecture that outperforms sequential approaches in denoising quality while maintaining classification accuracy; 2) NAS modifications that improve search stability and performance; 3) Demonstration of superior performance over manual designs across medical imaging, surveillance, and industrial inspection domains. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures achieve significant improvements in both denoising and classification compared to manually designed alternatives, while meeting strict latency constraints for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper proposes a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for distributed intelligence across edge-cloud systems. The key innovation is a hybrid architecture with quantized layers and early exits at the edge, while maintaining full-precision layers in the cloud. The system dynamically routes samples - easy inputs exit early at the edge while hard ones proceed to cloud processing. Experimental results show significant energy savings (5.5x on CIFAR-10, 4.8x on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision networks. The paper provides valuable insights into tradeoffs between bit-precision, number of edge layers, and early exit strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in edge image classification systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with specific memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates hardware metrics (FLOPs/memory) into the search objective.

Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) at low latency (13.7ms). The work demonstrates how NAS can effectively balance multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, denoising quality) for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel neural architecture search method that significantly reduces search time while optimizing for on-device performance. The key innovation is a "superkernel" approach that encodes all architectural decisions within a single-path network, eliminating the need for separate paths per operation. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, outperforming previous NAS methods while reducing search cost by up to 5,000x (to just 3.75 hours). The approach directly optimizes for target device latency through a differentiable formulation that jointly learns architecture parameters and kernel weights.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, modified Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6dB PSNR for denoising and 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet100 while meeting real-time latency constraints (13.7ms). The integrated approach demonstrates better denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on the trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms). The system demonstrates superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and learned feature compression methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that discovers Pareto-optimal architectures while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods. Experimental results show DCA-NAS achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models (97.2% on CIFAR-10, 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet) while being 15x smaller than manual architectures. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-time edge applications by discovering models with lower inference latency (shown on Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) through novel techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity (4x4 to 28x28 patches) and implementing operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in practical efficiency for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. The key innovation is a differentiable masking approach that jointly optimizes three critical architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (heart-rate monitoring, arrhythmia detection, hand-gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) demonstrate significant improvements: up to 152x parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy, and 5.5x/3.8x reductions in latency/energy on two different edge platforms (GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU) compared to hand-tuned models. The method achieves these results with search complexity comparable to a single training run, making it practical for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key innovations include: 1) A novel architecture that outperforms sequential approaches in denoising quality while maintaining classification accuracy; 2) NAS modifications that improve search stability and performance; 3) Demonstration of superior performance over manual designs across medical imaging, surveillance, and industrial inspection domains. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures achieve significant improvements in both denoising and classification compared to manually designed alternatives, while meeting strict latency constraints for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper proposes a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for distributed intelligence across edge-cloud systems. The key innovation is a hybrid architecture with quantized layers and early exits at the edge, while maintaining full-precision layers in the cloud. The system dynamically routes samples - easy inputs exit early at the edge while hard ones proceed to cloud processing. Experimental results show significant energy savings (5.5x on CIFAR-10, 4.8x on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision networks. The paper provides valuable insights into tradeoffs between bit-precision, number of edge layers, and early exit strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in edge image classification systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with specific memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates hardware metrics (FLOPs/memory) into the search objective. Experiments show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, demonstrating effective tradeoffs between model performance and hardware constraints critical for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) at low latency (13.7ms). The work demonstrates how NAS can effectively balance multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, denoising quality) for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel neural architecture search method that significantly reduces search time while optimizing for on-device performance. The key innovation is a "superkernel" approach that encodes all architectural decisions within a single-path network, eliminating the need for separate paths per operation. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, outperforming previous NAS methods while reducing search cost by up to 5,000x (to just 3.75 hours). The approach directly optimizes for target device latency through a differentiable formulation that jointly learns architecture parameters and kernel weights. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs for mobile devices.\\nPlan: Proposed Technique: "Resource-Aware Dynamic Patch Pruning" (RAD-PP) - A novel approach that dynamically prunes image patches during inference based on both input complexity and real-time device resource constraints (CPU load, memory pressure, battery level).

```DIALOGUE
I see the error - we need to properly handle the image data from the CIFAR-100 dataset which comes as a dictionary with PIL images. Let's modify the code to correctly extract and transform the images. Could you please:
1. First load the dataset without transforms to inspect the structure
2. Then create a function that properly extracts and transforms the 'img' field from each sample
3. Apply this transformation to both train and test sets

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, modified Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6dB PSNR for denoising and 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet100 while meeting real-time latency constraints (13.7ms). The integrated approach demonstrates better denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on the trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms). The system demonstrates superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and learned feature compression methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that discovers Pareto-optimal architectures while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods. Experimental results show DCA-NAS achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models (97.2% on CIFAR-10, 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet) while being 15x smaller than manual architectures. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-time edge applications by discovering models with lower inference latency (shown on Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) through novel techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity (4x4 to 28x28 patches) and implementing operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in practical efficiency for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. The key innovation is a differentiable masking approach that jointly optimizes three critical architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (heart-rate monitoring, arrhythmia detection, hand-gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) demonstrate significant improvements: up to 152x parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy, and 5.5x/3.8x reductions in latency/energy on two different edge platforms (GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU) compared to hand-tuned models. The method achieves these results with search complexity comparable to a single training run, making it practical for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key innovations include: 1) A novel architecture that outperforms sequential approaches in denoising quality while maintaining classification accuracy; 2) NAS modifications that improve search stability and performance; 3) Demonstration of superior performance over manual designs across medical imaging, surveillance, and industrial inspection domains. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures achieve significant improvements in both denoising and classification compared to manually designed alternatives, while meeting strict latency constraints for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper proposes a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for distributed intelligence across edge-cloud systems. The key innovation is a hybrid architecture with quantized layers and early exits at the edge, while maintaining full-precision layers in the cloud. The system dynamically routes samples - easy inputs exit early at the edge while hard ones proceed to cloud processing. Experimental results show significant energy savings (5.5x on CIFAR-10, 4.8x on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision networks. The paper provides valuable insights into tradeoffs between bit-precision, number of edge layers, and early exit strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in edge image classification systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with specific memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates hardware metrics (FLOPs/memory) into the search objective. Experiments show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, demonstrating effective tradeoffs between model performance and hardware constraints critical for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) at low latency (13.7ms). The work demonstrates how NAS can effectively balance multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, denoising quality) for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel neural architecture search method that significantly reduces search time while optimizing for on-device performance. The key innovation is a "superkernel" approach that encodes all architectural decisions within a single-path network, eliminating the need for separate paths per operation. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, outperforming previous NAS methods while reducing search cost by up to 5,000x (to just 3.75 hours). The approach directly optimizes for target device latency through a differentiable formulation that jointly learns architecture parameters and kernel weights. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs for mobile devices.\\nPlan: Proposed Technique: "Resource-Aware Dynamic Patch Pruning" (RAD-PP) - A novel approach that dynamically prunes image patches during inference based on both input complexity and real-time device resource constraints (CPU load, memory pressure, battery level).

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, modified Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6dB PSNR for denoising and 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet100 while meeting real-time latency constraints (13.7ms). The integrated approach demonstrates better denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on the trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms). The system demonstrates superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and learned feature compression methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that discovers Pareto-optimal architectures while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods. Experimental results show DCA-NAS achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models (97.2% on CIFAR-10, 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet) while being 15x smaller than manual architectures. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-time edge applications by discovering models with lower inference latency (shown on Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) through novel techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity (4x4 to 28x28 patches) and implementing operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in practical efficiency for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. The key innovation is a differentiable masking approach that jointly optimizes three critical architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (heart-rate monitoring, arrhythmia detection, hand-gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) demonstrate significant improvements: up to 152x parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy, and 5.5x/3.8x reductions in latency/energy on two different edge platforms (GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU) compared to hand-tuned models. The method achieves these results with search complexity comparable to a single training run, making it practical for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key innovations include: 1) A novel architecture that outperforms sequential approaches in denoising quality while maintaining classification accuracy; 2) NAS modifications that improve search stability and performance; 3) Demonstration of superior performance over manual designs across medical imaging, surveillance, and industrial inspection domains. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures achieve significant improvements in both denoising and classification compared to manually designed alternatives, while meeting strict latency constraints for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper proposes a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for distributed intelligence across edge-cloud systems. The key innovation is a hybrid architecture with quantized layers and early exits at the edge, while maintaining full-precision layers in the cloud. The system dynamically routes samples - easy inputs exit early at the edge while hard ones proceed to cloud processing. Experimental results show significant energy savings (5.5x on CIFAR-10, 4.8x on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision networks. The paper provides valuable insights into tradeoffs between bit-precision, number of edge layers, and early exit strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in edge image classification systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with specific memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates hardware metrics (FLOPs/memory) into the search objective. Experiments show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, demonstrating effective tradeoffs between model performance and hardware constraints critical for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) at low latency (13.7ms). The work demonstrates how NAS can effectively balance multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, denoising quality) for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel neural architecture search method that significantly reduces search time while optimizing for on-device performance. The key innovation is a "superkernel" approach that encodes all architectural decisions within a single-path network, eliminating the need for separate paths per operation. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, outperforming previous NAS methods while reducing search cost by up to 5,000x (to just 3.75 hours). The approach directly optimizes for target device latency through a differentiable formulation that jointly learns architecture parameters and kernel weights. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs for mobile devices.\\nPlan: Proposed Technique: "Resource-Aware Dynamic Patch Pruning" (RAD-PP) - A novel approach that dynamically prunes image patches during inference based on both input complexity and real-time device resource constraints (CPU load, memory pressure, battery level).

Response:
```DIALOGUE
Let's simplify the data loading and transformation process. Instead of applying transforms to the entire dataset at once (which causes timeout), let's:
1. Load the dataset without transforms
2. Create a transform function that we'll apply per batch during training
3. Just verify the basic dataset structure for now
This will be more efficient for edge device experiments. Could you implement this approach?

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, modified Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6dB PSNR for denoising and 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet100 while meeting real-time latency constraints (13.7ms). The integrated approach demonstrates better denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on the trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms). The system demonstrates superior RAC performance compared to both traditional image codecs and learned feature compression methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that discovers Pareto-optimal architectures while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior NAS methods. Experimental results show DCA-NAS achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models (97.2% on CIFAR-10, 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet) while being 15x smaller than manual architectures. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness for real-time edge applications by discovering models with lower inference latency (shown on Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) through novel techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing spatial granularity (4x4 to 28x28 patches) and implementing operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in practical efficiency for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. The key innovation is a differentiable masking approach that jointly optimizes three critical architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (heart-rate monitoring, arrhythmia detection, hand-gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) demonstrate significant improvements: up to 152x parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy, and 5.5x/3.8x reductions in latency/energy on two different edge platforms (GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU) compared to hand-tuned models. The method achieves these results with search complexity comparable to a single training run, making it practical for edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key innovations include: 1) A novel architecture that outperforms sequential approaches in denoising quality while maintaining classification accuracy; 2) NAS modifications that improve search stability and performance; 3) Demonstration of superior performance over manual designs across medical imaging, surveillance, and industrial inspection domains. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures achieve significant improvements in both denoising and classification compared to manually designed alternatives, while meeting strict latency constraints for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper proposes a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for distributed intelligence across edge-cloud systems. The key innovation is a hybrid architecture with quantized layers and early exits at the edge, while maintaining full-precision layers in the cloud. The system dynamically routes samples - easy inputs exit early at the edge while hard ones proceed to cloud processing. Experimental results show significant energy savings (5.5x on CIFAR-10, 4.8x on CIFAR-100) with minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision networks. The paper provides valuable insights into tradeoffs between bit-precision, number of edge layers, and early exit strategies for optimizing energy efficiency in edge image classification systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices with specific memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates hardware metrics (FLOPs/memory) into the search objective. Experiments show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, demonstrating effective tradeoffs between model performance and hardware constraints critical for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) at low latency (13.7ms). The work demonstrates how NAS can effectively balance multiple objectives (accuracy, latency, denoising quality) for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel neural architecture search method that significantly reduces search time while optimizing for on-device performance. The key innovation is a "superkernel" approach that encodes all architectural decisions within a single-path network, eliminating the need for separate paths per operation. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, outperforming previous NAS methods while reducing search cost by up to 5,000x (to just 3.75 hours). The approach directly optimizes for target device latency through a differentiable formulation that jointly learns architecture parameters and kernel weights. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs for mobile devices.\\nPlan: Proposed Technique: "Resource-Aware Dynamic Patch Pruning" (RAD-PP) - A novel approach that dynamically prunes image patches during inference based on both input complexity and real-time device resource constraints (CPU load, memory pressure, battery level).

The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline.

The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time.

The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving better efficiency than sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like surveillance systems where human verification of automated classifications is needed.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet demonstrate the framework\\'s ability to find Pareto optimal solutions that balance model size, FLOPs, and accuracy. The approach is particularly relevant for real-time image classification on edge devices as it automatically adapts to varying hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. PIT jointly optimizes three key architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor through a novel differentiable masking approach. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (PPG-based heart rate monitoring, ECG arrhythmia detection, sEMG gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) show PIT can find models with 15.9-152x fewer parameters than seed networks while maintaining accuracy. When deployed on GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU, PIT-optimized models achieve up to 5.5x latency reduction and 3.8x energy savings compared to hand-tuned baselines. The method is particularly notable for its efficient search process (comparable to single training) and ability to explore a large search space (up to 10^12 architectures) while maintaining low GPU memory requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving better efficiency than sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like surveillance systems where human verification of automated classifications is needed.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet demonstrate the framework\\'s ability to find Pareto optimal solutions that balance model size, FLOPs, and accuracy. The approach is particularly relevant for real-time image classification on edge devices as it automatically adapts to varying hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. PIT jointly optimizes three key architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor through a novel differentiable masking approach. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (PPG-based heart rate monitoring, ECG arrhythmia detection, sEMG gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) show PIT can find models with 15.9-152x fewer parameters than seed networks while maintaining accuracy. When deployed on GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU, PIT-optimized models achieve up to 5.5x latency reduction and 3.8x energy savings compared to hand-tuned baselines. The method is particularly notable for its efficient search process (comparable to single training) and ability to explore a large search space (up to 10^12 architectures) while maintaining low GPU memory requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method introduces weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS with similar performance. The approach is particularly notable for its ability to automatically adapt to different hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for real-world edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency over sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better human perception of noisy images while maintaining real-time performance on edge hardware. The integrated architecture reduces computational overhead by 45% compared to separate denoising and classification models, making it particularly suitable for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both machine classification and human verification are important.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates various model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning, dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization provides 95% parameter reduction. The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 3.8% accuracy improvement. On-device deployment demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency, validating effectiveness for edge deployment. The work provides comprehensive empirical analysis of compression tradeoffs for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2101.09336v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a detailed taxonomy and analysis of hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) methods. It categorizes approaches based on search space design, search strategies, acceleration techniques, and hardware cost estimation methods. The paper is particularly relevant as it focuses on optimizing neural architectures for resource-constrained platforms like edge devices, discussing tradeoffs between accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics (latency, energy, memory). It also identifies key challenges in deploying NAS-generated models on edge devices and suggests future research directions.\\narXiv ID: 2503.02891v3, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a systematic analysis of model compression and acceleration techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. It covers three main optimization approaches: (1) Model compression techniques including pruning (structured/unstructured, static/dynamic), knowledge distillation (logit-based, feature-based, relation-based), and quantization (uniform/non-uniform, PTQ/QAT); (2) Hardware-aware acceleration strategies for GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs; (3) Software-hardware co-design approaches. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different methods\\' impact on accuracy, efficiency (GFLOPS reduction up to 61.4%), and hardware adaptability, along with practical deployment considerations for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2005.02177v1, Summary: This paper presents Classification Driven Compression (CDC), a framework for edge-cloud collaborative deep learning that optimizes the tradeoff between bandwidth consumption and classification accuracy. The key innovation is a lightweight autoencoder with classification guidance that selectively preserves features critical for accurate classification while compressing data. CDC achieves 14.9x bandwidth reduction with \u22641.06% accuracy drop compared to raw data training, and outperforms standard autoencoders by at least 100% in accuracy preservation. The method includes an adjustable quantization scheme for dynamic compression ratio adaptation based on network conditions, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior work) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Key innovations include a differentiable resource constraint formulation and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs, with models that maintain performance while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS and having lower inference latency than PC-DARTS on edge devices.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Differentiable Joint Architecture-Compression Search (DJACS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

```DIALOGUE
The previous code timed out because we tried to process all images at once. Let's modify the approach to process images in batches during training instead. Could you please load the CIFAR-100 dataset without applying transforms immediately, and just set up the transform pipeline that will be applied during training? We'll keep the same train/val/test splits but defer the image processing.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving better efficiency than sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like surveillance systems where human verification of automated classifications is needed.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet demonstrate the framework\\'s ability to find Pareto optimal solutions that balance model size, FLOPs, and accuracy. The approach is particularly relevant for real-time image classification on edge devices as it automatically adapts to varying hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. PIT jointly optimizes three key architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor through a novel differentiable masking approach. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (PPG-based heart rate monitoring, ECG arrhythmia detection, sEMG gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) show PIT can find models with 15.9-152x fewer parameters than seed networks while maintaining accuracy. When deployed on GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU, PIT-optimized models achieve up to 5.5x latency reduction and 3.8x energy savings compared to hand-tuned baselines. The method is particularly notable for its efficient search process (comparable to single training) and ability to explore a large search space (up to 10^12 architectures) while maintaining low GPU memory requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method introduces weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS with similar performance. The approach is particularly notable for its ability to automatically adapt to different hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for real-world edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency over sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better human perception of noisy images while maintaining real-time performance on edge hardware. The integrated architecture reduces computational overhead by 45% compared to separate denoising and classification models, making it particularly suitable for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both machine classification and human verification are important.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates various model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning, dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization provides 95% parameter reduction. The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 3.8% accuracy improvement. On-device deployment demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency, validating effectiveness for edge deployment. The work provides comprehensive empirical analysis of compression tradeoffs for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2101.09336v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a detailed taxonomy and analysis of hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) methods. It categorizes approaches based on search space design, search strategies, acceleration techniques, and hardware cost estimation methods. The paper is particularly relevant as it focuses on optimizing neural architectures for resource-constrained platforms like edge devices, discussing tradeoffs between accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics (latency, energy, memory). It also identifies key challenges in deploying NAS-generated models on edge devices and suggests future research directions.\\narXiv ID: 2503.02891v3, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a systematic analysis of model compression and acceleration techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. It covers three main optimization approaches: (1) Model compression techniques including pruning (structured/unstructured, static/dynamic), knowledge distillation (logit-based, feature-based, relation-based), and quantization (uniform/non-uniform, PTQ/QAT); (2) Hardware-aware acceleration strategies for GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs; (3) Software-hardware co-design approaches. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different methods\\' impact on accuracy, efficiency (GFLOPS reduction up to 61.4%), and hardware adaptability, along with practical deployment considerations for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2005.02177v1, Summary: This paper presents Classification Driven Compression (CDC), a framework for edge-cloud collaborative deep learning that optimizes the tradeoff between bandwidth consumption and classification accuracy. The key innovation is a lightweight autoencoder with classification guidance that selectively preserves features critical for accurate classification while compressing data. CDC achieves 14.9x bandwidth reduction with \u22641.06% accuracy drop compared to raw data training, and outperforms standard autoencoders by at least 100% in accuracy preservation. The method includes an adjustable quantization scheme for dynamic compression ratio adaptation based on network conditions, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior work) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Key innovations include a differentiable resource constraint formulation and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs, with models that maintain performance while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS and having lower inference latency than PC-DARTS on edge devices.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Differentiable Joint Architecture-Compression Search (DJACS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show that their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR and 0.71 SSIM for denoising while maintaining 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet-100 at 13.7ms latency.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show that their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR and 0.71 SSIM for denoising while maintaining 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet-100 at 13.7ms latency. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior performance compared to sequential approaches, particularly in preserving image quality for human verification while meeting real-time constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on edge devices. Key experimental results show that combining OTOv3 pruning with dynamic quantization achieves 89.7% model size reduction and 95% reduction in parameters/MACs while improving accuracy by 3.8% on CIFAR-10. The compressed model demonstrates practical edge deployment with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms inference time. The work provides valuable empirical comparisons of compression techniques, showing structured pruning preserves accuracy better than unstructured methods, and quantization achieves the most significant parameter reduction (95%) with minimal accuracy impact.\\narXiv ID: 2106.06560v1, Summary: This paper presents HR-NAS, a neural architecture search method that optimizes high-resolution representations for real-time image classification on edge devices. The authors introduce a lightweight transformer module that can be dynamically scaled to balance accuracy and computational cost. HR-NAS achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs, demonstrating 45.9% improved efficiency over specialized segmentation models while maintaining accuracy. The method effectively combines multi-scale convolutional features with global attention mechanisms, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that reduces computational redundancy while maintaining contiguous memory access patterns crucial for GPU efficiency. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes a novel latency prediction model that guides architecture design by considering hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithmic parameters simultaneously.\\narXiv ID: 2108.07879v1, Summary: This paper presents NeuRRAM, a resistive RAM (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM) chip that achieves unprecedented energy efficiency for edge AI image classification. The key innovation is a cross-layer co-design approach that optimizes across device, circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels. NeuRRAM demonstrates 5-8\xd7 better energy efficiency than prior art while maintaining software-comparable accuracy (85.7% on CIFAR-10) with 4-bit weights. The architecture features a novel transposable neurosynaptic array enabling bidirectional dataflow and a voltage-mode neuron circuit supporting configurable bit-precisions (1-6 bit inputs, 1-8 bit outputs). Hardware-algorithm co-optimization techniques including noise-resilient training and chip-in-the-loop fine-tuning mitigate analog non-idealities. The chip achieves 70% lower image reconstruction error than noisy inputs while consuming minimal energy.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while increasing accuracy by 3.8%. Dynamic quantization alone reduces parameters by 95% with minimal accuracy drop (0.1%). The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time, validating effectiveness for real-time edge applications. The work provides comprehensive empirical comparisons of compression techniques\\' impact on model metrics.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to achieve 4-17x faster search times compared to prior hardware-aware NAS approaches. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets while maintaining low search costs (0.06 GPU days on ImageNet). Key innovations include differentiable resource constraints and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving superior efficiency compared to sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with the integrated architecture achieving better denoising quality (25.4 PSNR) and classification accuracy (76%) at 13.7ms latency. The method demonstrates effective trade-offs between computational efficiency and task performance, making it suitable for real-time edge applications like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method for designing efficient convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" formulation that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared convolutional parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. This approach reduces NAS search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 TPU-hours), achieving 5000x speedup compared to prior work. On ImageNet classification, the method achieves state-of-the-art 74.96% top-1 accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in both search efficiency and model performance for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper presents AutoShrink, a topology-aware neural architecture search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that starts with a complete directed acyclic graph (DAG) and iteratively removes redundant edges while accumulating topological knowledge. This method enables flexible exploration of network connectivity patterns within cell structures while intrinsically reducing the search space. For image classification on ImageNet-1K, AutoShrink achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MAC reduction compared to MobileNetV2 while maintaining comparable accuracy. The search process is highly efficient, requiring only 1.5 GPU hours for both CNN and RNN architectures. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in model efficiency and search cost for resource-constrained edge applications.\\nPlan: Proposed Experiment: "Input-Adaptive Neural Elasticity for Edge Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show that their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR and 0.71 SSIM for denoising while maintaining 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet-100 at 13.7ms latency. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior performance compared to sequential approaches, particularly in preserving image quality for human verification while meeting real-time constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on edge devices. Key experimental results show that combining OTOv3 pruning with dynamic quantization achieves 89.7% model size reduction and 95% reduction in parameters/MACs while improving accuracy by 3.8% on CIFAR-10. The compressed model demonstrates practical edge deployment with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms inference time. The work provides valuable empirical comparisons of compression techniques, showing structured pruning preserves accuracy better than unstructured methods, and quantization achieves the most significant parameter reduction (95%) with minimal accuracy impact.\\narXiv ID: 2106.06560v1, Summary: This paper presents HR-NAS, a neural architecture search method that optimizes high-resolution representations for real-time image classification on edge devices. The authors introduce a lightweight transformer module that can be dynamically scaled to balance accuracy and computational cost. HR-NAS achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs, demonstrating 45.9% improved efficiency over specialized segmentation models while maintaining accuracy. The method effectively combines multi-scale convolutional features with global attention mechanisms, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that reduces computational redundancy while maintaining contiguous memory access patterns crucial for GPU efficiency. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes a novel latency prediction model that guides architecture design by considering hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithmic parameters simultaneously.\\narXiv ID: 2108.07879v1, Summary: This paper presents NeuRRAM, a resistive RAM (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM) chip that achieves unprecedented energy efficiency for edge AI image classification. The key innovation is a cross-layer co-design approach that optimizes across device, circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels. NeuRRAM demonstrates 5-8\xd7 better energy efficiency than prior art while maintaining software-comparable accuracy (85.7% on CIFAR-10) with 4-bit weights. The architecture features a novel transposable neurosynaptic array enabling bidirectional dataflow and a voltage-mode neuron circuit supporting configurable bit-precisions (1-6 bit inputs, 1-8 bit outputs). Hardware-algorithm co-optimization techniques including noise-resilient training and chip-in-the-loop fine-tuning mitigate analog non-idealities. The chip achieves 70% lower image reconstruction error than noisy inputs while consuming minimal energy.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while increasing accuracy by 3.8%. Dynamic quantization alone reduces parameters by 95% with minimal accuracy drop (0.1%). The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time, validating effectiveness for real-time edge applications. The work provides comprehensive empirical comparisons of compression techniques\\' impact on model metrics.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to achieve 4-17x faster search times compared to prior hardware-aware NAS approaches. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets while maintaining low search costs (0.06 GPU days on ImageNet). Key innovations include differentiable resource constraints and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving superior efficiency compared to sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with the integrated architecture achieving better denoising quality (25.4 PSNR) and classification accuracy (76%) at 13.7ms latency. The method demonstrates effective trade-offs between computational efficiency and task performance, making it suitable for real-time edge applications like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method for designing efficient convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" formulation that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared convolutional parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. This approach reduces NAS search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 TPU-hours), achieving 5000x speedup compared to prior work. On ImageNet classification, the method achieves state-of-the-art 74.96% top-1 accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in both search efficiency and model performance for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper presents AutoShrink, a topology-aware neural architecture search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that starts with a complete directed acyclic graph (DAG) and iteratively removes redundant edges while accumulating topological knowledge. This method enables flexible exploration of network connectivity patterns within cell structures while intrinsically reducing the search space. For image classification on ImageNet-1K, AutoShrink achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MAC reduction compared to MobileNetV2 while maintaining comparable accuracy. The search process is highly efficient, requiring only 1.5 GPU hours for both CNN and RNN architectures. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in model efficiency and search cost for resource-constrained edge applications.\\nPlan: Proposed Experiment: "Input-Adaptive Neural Elasticity for Edge Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

```DIALOGUE
Let's try a completely different approach - we'll use the CIFAR-10 dataset instead of CIFAR-100 since it's smaller and simpler. We'll load just the first sample and apply a single transform to verify the pipeline works before scaling up. Should I proceed with this minimal CIFAR-10 version?

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Dynamic Resolution-Aware Neural Architecture Search (DR-NAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR and 0.71 SSIM for denoising while maintaining 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet-100 at 13.7ms latency. The work demonstrates significant improvements in human perception of noisy images while meeting real-time constraints on edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques for ConvNeXt architectures on edge devices, focusing on structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization. Key experimental results show that combining OTOv3 pruning with dynamic quantization achieves 89.7% model size reduction, 95% reduction in parameters/MACs, while improving accuracy by 3.8% on CIFAR-10. The compressed model demonstrates practical edge deployment with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms inference time. The work provides comprehensive analysis of compression tradeoffs and validates techniques through both cloud-based experiments and real edge device deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search method specifically designed for edge devices with hardware constraints. The approach incorporates device memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the optimization objective, using weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time. Key results show DCA-NAS achieves 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods while discovering models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy. On ImageNet-1k, it achieves 24.4% top-1 error with 5.3M parameters (1.9 GPU days search time). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to different device constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet (Latency-aware Spatial-wise Dynamic Networks), a framework for optimizing spatial-wise dynamic convolutions to improve practical inference efficiency on edge devices. The key innovation is a latency prediction model that considers algorithm design, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties to guide coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic approaches by optimizing spatial granularity and operator fusion for better memory access patterns. Results demonstrate effectiveness on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.\\narXiv ID: 2112.10948v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel task-oriented aerial image transmission framework for scene classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a deep reinforcement learning approach that dynamically selects the most informative image regions (semantic blocks) for compression and transmission based on channel conditions. This achieves an optimal tradeoff between classification accuracy and transmission latency. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional methods, with the system adapting compression levels to varying channel gains while maintaining high accuracy. The framework demonstrates how edge devices can efficiently offload complex vision tasks by transmitting only the most task-relevant image data.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches to improve edge offloading decisions for distorted images. The key innovation is training specialized side branches for different distortion types (e.g., blur, noise) while keeping a shared backbone. A distortion classifier first identifies the image distortion type, then selects corresponding expert branches for inference. Experiments show this approach increases edge classification accuracy by 15-20% for distorted images compared to standard early-exit DNNs, while reducing cloud offloading by 30-40%. The method achieves lower end-to-end latency (0.2-0.3s) across different network conditions when deployed with Amazon EC2 instances. The work demonstrates how adaptive model architectures can optimize edge-cloud collaboration under real-world input variations.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on edge devices. Key findings include: 1) OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters and 60% reduction in MACs while increasing accuracy by 3.8% on CIFAR-10. 2) Dynamic quantization alone reduces parameters/MACs by 95% with minimal accuracy drop (0.1%). 3) Combining both techniques yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time on edge hardware, demonstrating effective optimization for resource-constrained deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2105.04104v3, Summary: AppealNet proposes an edge/cloud collaborative architecture with a two-head neural network design that explicitly models inference difficulty to optimize the accuracy-computation tradeoff. The system dynamically decides whether to process inputs locally on edge devices or offload to the cloud, achieving up to 40% energy savings compared to confidence-based approaches while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on image classification tasks demonstrate superior performance over methods using softmax probability-based confidence metrics.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper proposes LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes inference efficiency for deep learning models on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers algorithm design, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on server GPUs and 46% on edge devices (Nvidia Jetson TX2) without accuracy loss.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet\\'s effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources, along with a single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-accuracy-complexity performance compared to existing methods, including traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression approaches. The system achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 0.93% better) while reducing encoding latency by 50% compared to baseline methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2401.10541v1, Summary: This paper introduces I-SplitEE, a novel approach combining split computing and early exits to optimize deep neural network inference on edge devices. The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%). The algorithm uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to adapt to changing data distributions in an online, unsupervised manner, making it particularly effective for real-world scenarios with varying image distortions. Experimental results on Caltech-256 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for converting trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) using optimized temporal coding with few spikes (FS-conversion). The key innovation is the FS-neuron model that encodes information in both spike timing and count, enabling high-accuracy image classification with an average of just 2 spikes per neuron. The method achieves 83.57% accuracy on ImageNet (comparable to the original ANN) while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The approach is particularly effective for edge devices, demonstrating improved latency and throughput through pipelined processing. The paper also shows successful application to various CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10), with detailed analysis of implementation costs on different neuromorphic hardware platforms.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Latency-Predictive Convex NAS" (LPC-NAS) - A novel hybrid approach combining:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet\\'s effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources, along with a single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-accuracy-complexity performance compared to existing methods, including traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression approaches. The system achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 0.93% better) while reducing encoding latency by 50% compared to baseline methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2401.10541v1, Summary: This paper introduces I-SplitEE, a novel approach combining split computing and early exits to optimize deep neural network inference on edge devices. The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%). The algorithm uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to adapt to changing data distributions in an online, unsupervised manner, making it particularly effective for real-world scenarios with varying image distortions. Experimental results on Caltech-256 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for converting trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) using optimized temporal coding with few spikes (FS-conversion). The key innovation is the FS-neuron model that encodes information in both spike timing and count, enabling high-accuracy image classification with an average of just 2 spikes per neuron. The method achieves 83.57% accuracy on ImageNet (comparable to the original ANN) while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The approach is particularly effective for edge devices, demonstrating improved latency and throughput through pipelined processing. The paper also shows successful application to various CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10), with detailed analysis of implementation costs on different neuromorphic hardware platforms.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Latency-Predictive Convex NAS" (LPC-NAS) - A novel hybrid approach combining:\\n1.

Let's try a simpler approach - we'll load the CIFAR-10 dataset without any transforms first, then we'll manually convert a small sample of images to tensors for testing purposes. This should avoid the timeout issues while still giving us usable data. Could you implement this basic loading approach?

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet\\'s effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources, along with a single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-accuracy-complexity performance compared to existing methods, including traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression approaches. The system achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 0.93% better) while reducing encoding latency by 50% compared to baseline methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2401.10541v1, Summary: This paper introduces I-SplitEE, a novel approach combining split computing and early exits to optimize deep neural network inference on edge devices. The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%). The algorithm uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to adapt to changing data distributions in an online, unsupervised manner, making it particularly effective for real-world scenarios with varying image distortions. Experimental results on Caltech-256 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for converting trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) using optimized temporal coding with few spikes (FS-conversion). The key innovation is the FS-neuron model that encodes information in both spike timing and count, enabling high-accuracy image classification with an average of just 2 spikes per neuron. The method achieves 83.57% accuracy on ImageNet (comparable to the original ANN) while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The approach is particularly effective for edge devices, demonstrating improved latency and throughput through pipelined processing. The paper also shows successful application to various CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10), with detailed analysis of implementation costs on different neuromorphic hardware platforms.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Latency-Predictive Convex NAS" (LPC-NAS) - A novel hybrid approach combining:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2011.14808v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper discusses deep learning optimization techniques for edge computing systems. It covers four main approaches: (1) hand-crafted lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, (2) model compression methods including pruning and quantization, (3) hardware-aware neural architecture search, and (4) adaptive deep learning models. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different techniques and their tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show these optimization methods can significantly reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy, making them suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches specialized for different image distortion types (blur and noise) to improve edge offloading efficiency. The key innovation is using a distortion classifier to select appropriate expert branches at each exit point, enabling more accurate early classification on edge devices. Experiments show the approach increases edge classification probability by 10-20% for distorted images while maintaining accuracy, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 30% compared to standard early-exit DNNs. The method is evaluated on Amazon EC2 instances across different geographic locations, demonstrating robustness under varying network conditions. The work provides important insights for optimizing real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices handling distorted inputs.\\narXiv ID: 2111.14243v1, Summary: EffCNet is an efficient version of CondenseNet designed for edge devices, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions and self-querying data augmentation to improve real-time inference performance. The paper demonstrates significant reductions in model size (from 16.7MB to 2.1MB for CIFAR-10), FLOPs (from 65.82M to 61.01M), and parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy (94.15% top-1 on CIFAR-10). The architecture was successfully deployed on NXP BlueBox 2.0, an edge platform for autonomous vehicles, showing practical applicability for resource-constrained environments.\\narXiv ID: 2502.10047v1, Summary: This paper presents Janus, a novel framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer (ViT) inference over dynamic networks. The key innovation is combining token pruning techniques with a fine-to-coarse model splitting policy to enable efficient ViT execution across edge and cloud resources. Janus dynamically selects optimal pruning levels and split points based on network conditions, achieving up to 5.15x throughput improvement and reducing latency violations by up to 98.7% compared to baselines while maintaining accuracy. The system includes a lightweight profiler for latency prediction and a dynamic scheduler for real-time configuration. Experimental results demonstrate Janus\\'s effectiveness across image recognition and video classification tasks under various network conditions.\\narXiv ID: 2404.10407v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper evaluates four primary model compression techniques (quantization, low-rank approximation, knowledge distillation, and pruning) for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for edge deployment. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR datasets, the authors demonstrate that post-training quantization and knowledge distillation achieve the best trade-offs, reducing model size by 4x while maintaining accuracy. The paper also explores hybrid approaches, showing that combining quantization with knowledge distillation can double inference speed while reducing model size to 25% of original. Key findings include: 1) Dynamic quantization reduces ViT size to 84MB (from 327MB) with minimal accuracy drop (98.73% vs 98.94% on CIFAR-10), 2) DeiT tiny achieves 16.78 iterations/sec (vs 4.48 for vanilla ViT) with 95.43% accuracy, and 3) Hybrid approaches combining quantization and distillation achieve 2x speedup with manageable accuracy trade-offs.\\narXiv ID: 2303.08810v1, Summary: BiFormer introduces a novel bi-level routing attention (BRA) mechanism for vision transformers that enables dynamic, query-aware sparsity. BRA first filters irrelevant key-value pairs at a coarse region level (region-to-region routing) before applying fine-grained token-to-token attention in the remaining regions. This approach achieves O((HW)^(4/3)) complexity with proper region partitioning while maintaining global receptive fields. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification (83.8% top-1 accuracy for BiFormer-S), COCO object detection (47.1 mAP for BiFormer-B), and ADE20K semantic segmentation (49.9 mIoU for BiFormer-B). The method shows particular strength in preserving fine-grained details for small object detection, with BiFormer-S achieving 30.2 APs on COCO compared to 29.2 for WaveViT-S.\\narXiv ID: 2212.02687v3, Summary: This paper investigates dynamic inference techniques for vision transformers to enable efficient execution under varying resource constraints. Key findings include: (1) Convolutions dominate FLOPs in modern vision transformers (68-89%), not attention layers, due to integrated convolutions for accuracy/performance. (2) FLOP distribution poorly predicts GPU runtime due to optimized convolution execution.

Key findings include: (1) Convolutions dominate FLOPs in modern vision transformers (68-89%), not attention layers, due to integrated convolutions for accuracy/performance. (2) FLOP distribution poorly predicts GPU runtime due to optimized convolution execution. (3) Models show varying resilience to pruning - SegFormer achieves 28% energy savings with 1.4% accuracy drop without retraining, while ResNet-50 (via OFA) achieves 53% energy savings with 3.3% accuracy drop. The work provides insights for designing efficient vision transformers and dynamic execution strategies for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2405.00906v1, Summary: LOTUS introduces a novel method combining data lottery ticket selection and sparsity pruning to accelerate vision transformer training while maintaining accuracy. The approach identifies informative data subsets and eliminates redundant parameters through a three-phase process: (1) attention-map-based data lottery ticket identification, (2) Instant Sparse Soup Pruning (ISSP) for model compression, and (3) fine-tuning. Experiments show rapid convergence (reaching near-SOTA performance by 5 epochs) and maintain 79% accuracy at 30% sparsity on CIFAR-10, though ISSP showed accuracy drops due to aggressive pruning. The work demonstrates promising directions for efficient transformer training through combined data and model optimization.\\narXiv ID: 2111.15667v3, Summary: This paper introduces Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS), a parameter-free module for dynamically reducing the number of tokens in vision transformers based on input content.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2011.14808v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper discusses deep learning optimization techniques for edge computing systems. It covers four main approaches: (1) hand-crafted lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, (2) model compression methods including pruning and quantization, (3) hardware-aware neural architecture search, and (4) adaptive deep learning models. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different techniques and their tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show these optimization methods can significantly reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy, making them suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches specialized for different image distortion types (blur and noise) to improve edge offloading efficiency. The key innovation is using a distortion classifier to select appropriate expert branches at each exit point, enabling more accurate early classification on edge devices. Experiments show the approach increases edge classification probability by 10-20% for distorted images while maintaining accuracy, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 30% compared to standard early-exit DNNs. The method is evaluated on Amazon EC2 instances across different geographic locations, demonstrating robustness under varying network conditions. The work provides important insights for optimizing real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices handling distorted inputs.\\narXiv ID: 2111.14243v1, Summary: EffCNet is an efficient version of CondenseNet designed for edge devices, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions and self-querying data augmentation to improve real-time inference performance. The paper demonstrates significant reductions in model size (from 16.7MB to 2.1MB for CIFAR-10), FLOPs (from 65.82M to 61.01M), and parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy (94.15% top-1 on CIFAR-10). The architecture was successfully deployed on NXP BlueBox 2.0, an edge platform for autonomous vehicles, showing practical applicability for resource-constrained environments.\\narXiv ID: 2502.10047v1, Summary: This paper presents Janus, a novel framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer (ViT) inference over dynamic networks. The key innovation is combining token pruning techniques with a fine-to-coarse model splitting policy to enable efficient ViT execution across edge and cloud resources. Janus dynamically selects optimal pruning levels and split points based on network conditions, achieving up to 5.15x throughput improvement and reducing latency violations by up to 98.7% compared to baselines while maintaining accuracy. The system includes a lightweight profiler for latency prediction and a dynamic scheduler for real-time configuration. Experimental results demonstrate Janus\\'s effectiveness across image recognition and video classification tasks under various network conditions.\\narXiv ID: 2404.10407v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper evaluates four primary model compression techniques (quantization, low-rank approximation, knowledge distillation, and pruning) for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for edge deployment. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR datasets, the authors demonstrate that post-training quantization and knowledge distillation achieve the best trade-offs, reducing model size by 4x while maintaining accuracy. The paper also explores hybrid approaches, showing that combining quantization with knowledge distillation can double inference speed while reducing model size to 25% of original. Key findings include: 1) Dynamic quantization reduces ViT size to 84MB (from 327MB) with minimal accuracy drop (98.73% vs 98.94% on CIFAR-10), 2) DeiT tiny achieves 16.78 iterations/sec (vs 4.48 for vanilla ViT) with 95.43% accuracy, and 3) Hybrid approaches combining quantization and distillation achieve 2x speedup with manageable accuracy trade-offs.\\narXiv ID: 2303.08810v1, Summary: BiFormer introduces a novel bi-level routing attention (BRA) mechanism for vision transformers that enables dynamic, query-aware sparsity. BRA first filters irrelevant key-value pairs at a coarse region level (region-to-region routing) before applying fine-grained token-to-token attention in the remaining regions. This approach achieves O((HW)^(4/3)) complexity with proper region partitioning while maintaining global receptive fields. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification (83.8% top-1 accuracy for BiFormer-S), COCO object detection (47.1 mAP for BiFormer-B), and ADE20K semantic segmentation (49.9 mIoU for BiFormer-B). The method shows particular strength in preserving fine-grained details for small object detection, with BiFormer-S achieving 30.2 APs on COCO compared to 29.2 for WaveViT-S.\\narXiv ID: 2212.02687v3, Summary: This paper investigates dynamic inference techniques for vision transformers to enable efficient execution under varying resource constraints.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency. The integrated approach demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The approach uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key results show DCA-NAS discovers models 15x smaller than manual architectures with only 1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10, and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet-1k while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS. The method demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and search spaces, with search times 4-17x faster than previous hardware-aware NAS approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for algorithm design, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method achieves these gains through optimized spatial granularity selection and operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements over pixel-level dynamic networks in practical deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper presents a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge, reducing both computation and communication costs. Experimental results show the approach achieves 5.5x energy reduction on CIFAR-10 (processing 65% of samples at edge) and 4.8x reduction on CIFAR-100 while maintaining accuracy. The hybrid quantization strategy and joint optimization of early exits demonstrate significant improvements over full-precision networks for distributed intelligence systems.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC trade-off). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities, along with a single-stage training strategy. Key results show their method achieves 51.4% lower encoding latency and 0.93% higher accuracy compared to prior work (Entropic Student), while supporting adjustable complexity levels. The system demonstrates superior RAC performance across different bit rates, particularly excelling at lower bit rates (0.1-0.8 bpp) where it maintains accuracy while reducing computational overhead.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives by significant margins - achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency, while reducing computational overhead. The integrated design proves particularly effective for human-in-the-loop applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both classification and visual clarity are crucial.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices by viewing NAS as selecting subsets of weights from an over-parameterized "superkernel" rather than choosing between separate paths. Key innovations include: (1) A single-path formulation that reduces search cost to 8 epochs (30 TPU-hours), achieving up to 5,000x speedup over prior work; (2) Direct optimization for target device latency (79ms on Pixel 1) through a differentiable runtime model; (3) State-of-the-art 74.96% ImageNet accuracy in the <80ms latency range. The method demonstrates how hardware-aware NAS can efficiently discover Pareto-optimal architectures by jointly optimizing accuracy and on-device performance.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents an attention-aware semantic communication framework for collaborative inference between edge devices and cloud servers using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Key innovations include: (1) Attention-aware patch selection that leverages edge device attention scores to identify and transmit only critical image patches (reducing communication overhead by 68% on ImageNet); (2) Entropy-aware transmission that uses min-entropy to determine when to offload computation to the server; (3) A novel finding that lightweight edge models (DeiT-Tiny) can better identify semantically important patches than larger server models despite lower classification accuracy. The framework achieves server-level accuracy (80.84% vs DeiT-Base\\'s 81.8%) while significantly reducing both communication costs and server computation through selective patch processing. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to prior methods like MAE-based offloading, with particular advantages in low-bandwidth scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with only one transformer encoder layer. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100), audio classification (Speech Commands, GTZAN), and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness across modalities. Key results show SL-ViT achieves higher accuracy in 26/27 tested scenarios while reducing parameters and FLOPS. The paper also introduces a copycat fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further improves performance. This work enables more efficient dynamic inference for edge devices through improved early exit architectures.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show structured pruning (OTOV3) achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization reduces parameters by 95%. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and quantization yields 89.7% size reduction, 95% parameter/MAC reduction, and 3.8% accuracy improvement. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency. The integrated approach demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The approach uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key results show DCA-NAS discovers models 15x smaller than manual architectures with only 1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10, and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet-1k while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS. The method demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and search spaces, with search times 4-17x faster than previous hardware-aware NAS approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for algorithm design, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method achieves these gains through optimized spatial granularity selection and operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements over pixel-level dynamic networks in practical deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper presents a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge, reducing both computation and communication costs. Experimental results show the approach achieves 5.5x energy reduction on CIFAR-10 (processing 65% of samples at edge) and 4.8x reduction on CIFAR-100 while maintaining accuracy. The hybrid quantization strategy and joint optimization of early exits demonstrate significant improvements over full-precision networks for distributed intelligence systems.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC trade-off). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities, along with a single-stage training strategy. Key results show their method achieves 51.4% lower encoding latency and 0.93% higher accuracy compared to prior work (Entropic Student), while supporting adjustable complexity levels. The system demonstrates superior RAC performance across different bit rates, particularly excelling at lower bit rates (0.1-0.8 bpp) where it maintains accuracy while reducing computational overhead.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives by significant margins - achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency, while reducing computational overhead. The integrated design proves particularly effective for human-in-the-loop applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both classification and visual clarity are crucial.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices by viewing NAS as selecting subsets of weights from an over-parameterized "superkernel" rather than choosing between separate paths. Key innovations include: (1) A single-path formulation that reduces search cost to 8 epochs (30 TPU-hours), achieving up to 5,000x speedup over prior work; (2) Direct optimization for target device latency (79ms on Pixel 1) through a differentiable runtime model; (3) State-of-the-art 74.96% ImageNet accuracy in the <80ms latency range. The method demonstrates how hardware-aware NAS can efficiently discover Pareto-optimal architectures by jointly optimizing accuracy and on-device performance.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents an attention-aware semantic communication framework for collaborative inference between edge devices and cloud servers using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Key innovations include: (1) Attention-aware patch selection that leverages edge device attention scores to identify and transmit only critical image patches (reducing communication overhead by 68% on ImageNet); (2) Entropy-aware transmission that uses min-entropy to determine when to offload computation to the server; (3) A novel finding that lightweight edge models (DeiT-Tiny) can better identify semantically important patches than larger server models despite lower classification accuracy. The framework achieves server-level accuracy (80.84% vs DeiT-Base\\'s 81.8%) while significantly reducing both communication costs and server computation through selective patch processing. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to prior methods like MAE-based offloading, with particular advantages in low-bandwidth scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with only one transformer encoder layer. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100), audio classification (Speech Commands, GTZAN), and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness across modalities. Key results show SL-ViT achieves higher accuracy in 26/27 tested scenarios while reducing parameters and FLOPS. The paper also introduces a copycat fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further improves performance. This work enables more efficient dynamic inference for edge devices through improved early exit architectures.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show structured pruning (OTOV3) achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization reduces parameters by 95%. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and quantization yields 89.7% size reduction, 95% parameter/MAC reduction, and 3.8% accuracy improvement. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time. The work provides empirical evidence that structured pruning combined with quantization is highly effective for optimizing CNNs for edge devices while preserving performance.\\nPlan: Research Title: "Edge-Adaptive Vision Transformer with Dynamic Patch Resolution and Early Exiting"\\n\\nObjective:\\nDevelop a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that dynamically adapts to both input complexity and device resource constraints through three coordinated mechanisms: (1) dynamic patch resolution adjustment, (2) attention head pruning, and (3) early exiting decisions.\\n\\nKey Innovations:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency. The integrated approach demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential models while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and FLOPs constraints directly into the search objective. The approach uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key results show DCA-NAS discovers models 15x smaller than manual architectures with only 1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10, and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet-1k while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS. The method demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and search spaces, with search times 4-17x faster than previous hardware-aware NAS approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for algorithm design, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties. Experimental results show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 inference latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method achieves these gains through optimized spatial granularity selection and operator fusion techniques, demonstrating significant improvements over pixel-level dynamic networks in practical deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper presents a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge, reducing both computation and communication costs. Experimental results show the approach achieves 5.5x energy reduction on CIFAR-10 (processing 65% of samples at edge) and 4.8x reduction on CIFAR-100 while maintaining accuracy. The hybrid quantization strategy and joint optimization of early exits demonstrate significant improvements over full-precision networks for distributed intelligence systems.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC trade-off). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on edge device capabilities, along with a single-stage training strategy. Key results show their method achieves 51.4% lower encoding latency and 0.93% higher accuracy compared to prior work (Entropic Student), while supporting adjustable complexity levels. The system demonstrates superior RAC performance across different bit rates, particularly excelling at lower bit rates (0.1-0.8 bpp) where it maintains accuracy while reducing computational overhead.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives by significant margins - achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency, while reducing computational overhead. The integrated design proves particularly effective for human-in-the-loop applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both classification and visual clarity are crucial.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices by viewing NAS as selecting subsets of weights from an over-parameterized "superkernel" rather than choosing between separate paths. Key innovations include: (1) A single-path formulation that reduces search cost to 8 epochs (30 TPU-hours), achieving up to 5,000x speedup over prior work; (2) Direct optimization for target device latency (79ms on Pixel 1) through a differentiable runtime model; (3) State-of-the-art 74.96% ImageNet accuracy in the <80ms latency range. The method demonstrates how hardware-aware NAS can efficiently discover Pareto-optimal architectures by jointly optimizing accuracy and on-device performance.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents an attention-aware semantic communication framework for collaborative inference between edge devices and cloud servers using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Key innovations include: (1) Attention-aware patch selection that leverages edge device attention scores to identify and transmit only critical image patches (reducing communication overhead by 68% on ImageNet); (2) Entropy-aware transmission that uses min-entropy to determine when to offload computation to the server; (3) A novel finding that lightweight edge models (DeiT-Tiny) can better identify semantically important patches than larger server models despite lower classification accuracy. The framework achieves server-level accuracy (80.84% vs DeiT-Base\\'s 81.8%) while significantly reducing both communication costs and server computation through selective patch processing. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to prior methods like MAE-based offloading, with particular advantages in low-bandwidth scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with only one transformer encoder layer. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100), audio classification (Speech Commands, GTZAN), and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness across modalities. Key results show SL-ViT achieves higher accuracy in 26/27 tested scenarios while reducing parameters and FLOPS. The paper also introduces a copycat fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further improves performance. This work enables more efficient dynamic inference for edge devices through improved early exit architectures.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show structured pruning (OTOV3) achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization reduces parameters by 95%. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and quantization yields 89.7% size reduction, 95% parameter/MAC reduction, and 3.8% accuracy improvement. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time. The work provides empirical evidence that structured pruning combined with quantization is highly effective for optimizing CNNs for edge devices while preserving performance.\\nPlan: Research Title: "Edge-Adaptive Vision Transformer with Dynamic Patch Resolution and Early Exiting"\\n\\nObjective:\\nDevelop a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that dynamically adapts to both input complexity and device resource constraints through three coordinated mechanisms: (1) dynamic patch resolution adjustment, (2) attention head pruning, and (3) early exiting decisions.\\n\\nKey Innovations:\\n1.

Key results show their method achieves 51.4% lower encoding latency and 0.93% higher accuracy compared to prior work (Entropic Student), while supporting adjustable complexity levels. The system demonstrates superior RAC performance across different bit rates, particularly excelling at lower bit rates (0.1-0.8 bpp) where it maintains accuracy while reducing computational overhead.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives by significant margins - achieving 25.4 PSNR and 76% accuracy on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency, while reducing computational overhead. The integrated design proves particularly effective for human-in-the-loop applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both classification and visual clarity are crucial.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices by viewing NAS as selecting subsets of weights from an over-parameterized "superkernel" rather than choosing between separate paths. Key innovations include: (1) A single-path formulation that reduces search cost to 8 epochs (30 TPU-hours), achieving up to 5,000x speedup over prior work; (2) Direct optimization for target device latency (79ms on Pixel 1) through a differentiable runtime model; (3) State-of-the-art 74.96% ImageNet accuracy in the <80ms latency range. The method demonstrates how hardware-aware NAS can efficiently discover Pareto-optimal architectures by jointly optimizing accuracy and on-device performance.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents an attention-aware semantic communication framework for collaborative inference between edge devices and cloud servers using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Key innovations include: (1) Attention-aware patch selection that leverages edge device attention scores to identify and transmit only critical image patches (reducing communication overhead by 68% on ImageNet); (2) Entropy-aware transmission that uses min-entropy to determine when to offload computation to the server; (3) A novel finding that lightweight edge models (DeiT-Tiny) can better identify semantically important patches than larger server models despite lower classification accuracy. The framework achieves server-level accuracy (80.84% vs DeiT-Base\\'s 81.8%) while significantly reducing both communication costs and server computation through selective patch processing. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to prior methods like MAE-based offloading, with particular advantages in low-bandwidth scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2105.09121v3, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Layer Vision Transformers (SL-ViT) for early exiting in multi-exit architectures, significantly improving accuracy over conventional CNN-based early exits while reducing computational overhead. The method combines local and global receptive fields through a modified vision transformer architecture with only one transformer encoder layer. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100), audio classification (Speech Commands, GTZAN), and audiovisual crowd counting demonstrate SL-ViT\\'s effectiveness across modalities. Key results show SL-ViT achieves higher accuracy in 26/27 tested scenarios while reducing parameters and FLOPS. The paper also introduces a copycat fine-tuning strategy (CC-SL-ViT) that further improves performance. This work enables more efficient dynamic inference for edge devices through improved early exit architectures.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show structured pruning (OTOV3) achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization reduces parameters by 95%. The combination of OTOV3 pruning and quantization yields 89.7% size reduction, 95% parameter/MAC reduction, and 3.8% accuracy improvement. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time. The work provides empirical evidence that structured pruning combined with quantization is highly effective for optimizing CNNs for edge devices while preserving performance.\\nPlan: Research Title: "Edge-Adaptive Vision Transformer with Dynamic Patch Resolution and Early Exiting"\\n\\nObjective:\\nDevelop a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that dynamically adapts to both input complexity and device resource constraints through three coordinated mechanisms: (1) dynamic patch resolution adjustment, (2) attention head pruning, and (3) early exiting decisions.\\n\\nKey Innovations:\\n1.
