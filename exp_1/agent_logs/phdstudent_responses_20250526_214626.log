This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving better efficiency than sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with significant improvements in both denoising (25.6dB PSNR) and classification (76% accuracy) while maintaining real-time performance (13.7ms latency). The work demonstrates how edge-optimized architectures can balance computational constraints with perceptual quality for applications like surveillance and medical imaging.
