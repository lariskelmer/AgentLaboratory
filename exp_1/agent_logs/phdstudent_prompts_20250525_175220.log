Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Onlythe orange stages are searchable in the encoder and classifier.the classification performance improves by 1.7%, yet the denoising performanceplateaus. LPIENet denoises the worst. Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size. We co\n```\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #2, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.
