```DIALOGUE
Let's brainstorm a novel approach building on these papers. I notice most works focus on either NAS or model compression separately. What if we combine them with a new twist - using NAS to optimize not just architecture but also compression parameters (pruning ratios, quantization bits) jointly? We could call this "Compression-Aware Neural Architecture Search" (CA-NAS). What do you think about this direction for edge image classification?

```PLAN
Title: "Hardware-in-the-Loop Neural Architecture Search with Joint Compression Optimization (HIL-CA-NAS)"

Objective: Develop a novel NAS framework that jointly optimizes architecture parameters and compression techniques (pruning/quantization) using real-time hardware feedback from target edge devices.

Key Components:
1. Search Space:
   - Architecture parameters (conv layers, channels, etc.)
   - Pruning ratios (structured/unstructured)
   - Quantization bits (weights/activations)

2. Hardware Feedback Loop:
   - Direct measurement of latency/power on target device (Raspberry Pi 4)
   - Automated performance profiling during search
   - Dynamic adjustment of search based on hardware metrics

3. Implementation:
   - Use differentiable NAS framework (e.g. DARTS) extended with compression parameters
   - Add hardware interface module for real-time measurements
   - Implement multi-objective optimization (accuracy, latency, power)

Experiment Design:
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (for rapid prototyping)
- Baseline: MobileNetV2 (unoptimized)
- Target Device: Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)
- Evaluation Metrics: 
  - Accuracy (top-1)
  - Inference latency (ms)
  - Power consumption (mW)
  - Model size (MB)

Expected Innovations:
1. First NAS method to jointly optimize architecture and compression with hardware feedback
2. Eliminates proxy metrics (FLOPs) in favor of real hardware measurements
3. Automated discovery of optimal accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs for specific edge devices

Timeline:
1. Week 1-2: Implement base NAS framework with compression parameters
2. Week 3: Develop hardware interface module
3. Week 4: Run initial search experiments
4. Week 5: Compare against baselines and analyze results
