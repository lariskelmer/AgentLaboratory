```DIALOGUE
Let's start by loading the CIFAR-10 dataset from HuggingFace datasets. We'll need both the clean version for classification and the corrupted CIFAR-10-C version for testing denoising capabilities. Would you like me to show you how to load these datasets with minimal preprocessing for edge device experimentation?
