In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nreal-time edge image classification optimization\n```.
