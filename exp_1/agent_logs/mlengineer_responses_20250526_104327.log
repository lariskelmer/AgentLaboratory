ImageNet-1k subset 50 classes
```

=== Interaction 2 ===
Response:
```DIALOGUE
The 'beans' dataset is too small (only 3 classes) for our experiment which requires 50 classes. Let's use the 'frgfm/imagenette' dataset - it's a 10-class subset of ImageNet that's more suitable than beans, though we'll need to expand it to meet our 50-class requirement. Would you like me to proceed with loading imagenette as our base dataset and then discuss how to augment it to 50 classes?
```

Response:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("frgfm/imagenette")
print(f"Loaded dataset with {len(dataset['train'])} training samples and {len(dataset['validation'])} validation samples")
print(f"Classes: {dataset['train'].features['label'].names}")
```
