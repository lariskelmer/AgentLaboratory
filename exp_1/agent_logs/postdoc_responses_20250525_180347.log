```DIALOGUE
Let's brainstorm an innovative experiment building on these papers. I notice several works focus on NAS and compression for edge devices, but none combine dynamic architecture adaptation with real-time power monitoring. How about we design a system that dynamically adjusts model architecture (pruning level/quantization) based on current power constraints? We could use a lightweight RL agent to make these decisions in real-time. What do you think would be a good simple experiment to validate this concept?
