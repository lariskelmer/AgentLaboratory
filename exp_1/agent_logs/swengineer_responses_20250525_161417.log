Let's start with a simple data preparation step. Since the plan specifies CIFAR-10 for rapid prototyping, we'll load the CIFAR-10 dataset from HuggingFace. We'll need both training and test sets, and we should normalize the images to help with model training. Would you like me to proceed with this basic setup?
