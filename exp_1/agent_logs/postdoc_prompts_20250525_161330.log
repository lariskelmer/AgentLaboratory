The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with 13.7ms latency. The integrated approach demonstrates superior human perception benefits compared to sequential models, particularly in noisy conditions.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on edge devices. Key experimental results show: 1) OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOv3+quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MACs reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model demonstrates practical edge deployment with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms inference time on a laptop CPU.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search method optimized for edge devices with constraints on model size and computational resources. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device memory and FLOPs constraints. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time while maintaining accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS approaches. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when varying resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2107.12486v1, Summary: This paper investigates AI multi-tenancy techniques for edge devices, focusing on concurrent model executions (CME) and dynamic model placements (DMP) to optimize deep learning inference performance. The authors conduct extensive experiments on various edge devices (Jetson TX2/Nano, Raspberry Pi 4) and EdgeTPU accelerators using image classification models. Key findings show that CME can achieve 1.9-3.3\xd7 higher throughput by parallel execution, while DMP leveraging heterogeneous resources (GPU+EdgeTPU) achieves up to 3.8\xd7 throughput improvement. The paper provides valuable insights into resource contention, optimal concurrency levels, and tradeoffs between throughput and latency for real-time edge AI applications.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper proposes LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes inference efficiency for edge devices by performing coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference. The key innovation is a latency prediction model that guides algorithm design and scheduling optimization by considering hardware properties, achieving up to 46% latency reduction on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection demonstrate significant improvements in practical inference efficiency compared to pixel-level dynamic networks.\\narXiv ID: 2108.07879v1, Summary: This paper presents NeuRRAM, a resistive RAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) chip that achieves unprecedented energy efficiency for edge AI applications. The key innovation is a cross-layer co-design approach that optimizes across device, circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels. The chip demonstrates 5-8x better energy efficiency than prior art while maintaining software-comparable accuracy (99.0% on MNIST, 85.7% on CIFAR-10) across diverse AI workloads including CNNs, LSTMs, and RBMs. The voltage-mode neuron circuit and transposable neurosynaptic array architecture enable flexible dataflow directions and variable bit-precision computation (1-6 bit inputs, 1-8 bit outputs).\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving up to 76.4% classification accuracy while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR) at low latency (10-18ms). The integrated design reduces computational overhead compared to sequential approaches while preserving human-interpretable image quality.\\narXiv ID: 2107.12486v1, Summary: This paper investigates AI multi-tenancy techniques for edge devices, focusing on concurrent model executions (CME) and dynamic model placements (DMP) to optimize deep learning inference. The authors empirically evaluate these approaches on various edge devices (Jetson TX2/Nano, Raspberry Pi) and AI accelerators (EdgeTPU) using image classification tasks. Key findings show that CME improves throughput by 1.3-3.3\xd7 by running multiple models in parallel, while DMP achieves up to 3.8\xd7 higher throughput by strategically placing models across heterogeneous resources (CPU/GPU/EdgeTPU). The paper provides valuable insights into resource utilization patterns, concurrency limits, and performance trade-offs when deploying multiple DL models on edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches to improve edge offloading efficiency for distorted image classification. The key innovation is training specialized side branches for different distortion types (e.g., blur, noise) while maintaining a shared backbone. A distortion classifier first identifies the input image's distortion type, then selects corresponding expert branches for inference. Experiments show this approach achieves higher accuracy (up to 20% improvement) and reduces cloud offloading by 30-50% compared to standard early-exit DNNs. The method demonstrates 1.5-3x lower end-to-end latency in real-world tests using Amazon EC2 across different network conditions. The work provides valuable insights for adaptive inference optimization under real-world image quality variations.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a hardware-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates device constraints like memory and FLOPs directly into the NAS objective function through constrained optimization. Key innovations include weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to reduce search time, and a differentiable resource constraint formulation that eliminates the need for tunable scaling factors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method achieves 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with just 3.4M parameters, demonstrating effective optimization of the accuracy-latency tradeoff for edge deployment.")\n~~~~~~~~~~\nHistory: \n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #0, Phase: plan formulation\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: \nNotes: Notes for the task objective: [{'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'You are part of an autonomous agent system designed to assist real researchers in literature reviews.'}, {'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'Your goal is to develop a structured plan to conduct a literature review on Edge AI, focusing on performing and organizing key research tasks efficiently.'}, {'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'Devise a set of keywords and/or a Boolean search expression that captures the main ideas and subtopics relevant to Edge AI.
