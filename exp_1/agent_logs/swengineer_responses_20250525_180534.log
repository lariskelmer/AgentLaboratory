Response:
```DIALOGUE
Let's start by loading the CIFAR-10 dataset from HuggingFace. We'll need both the training and test sets for our experiment. Since we're working with edge devices, we should keep the dataset simple without complex preprocessing. Would you like to proceed with loading CIFAR-10 directly from HuggingFace datasets?```
