Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Onlythe orange stages are searchable in the encoder and classifier.the classification performance improves by 1.7%, yet the denoising performanceplateaus. LPIENet denoises the worst. Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size. We co\n```\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #2, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net). Both the baseline and reduced DC-Net use thesame classifier (MB2.5-M Suppl. A). Whereas UNet-S and UNet are used for thereduced and baseline DC-Net respectively.Forjoiningthedenoiserandclassifier,weproposetwomodels:(i)aSequentialmodel where the classifier is attached after the denoiser (Fig. 2.i), and (ii) anIntegrated model, the classifier is attached to the UNet encoder (Fig. 2.ii). Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1). We report the metrics averaged over all 11noise levels,\u03c3 in [0, 1].L = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LChar (1)Exp 1. Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models. Both the Integratedand Sequential methods trained on the synthetic noise dataset. The integrated modelperforms significantly better in denoising and slightly worse in classification.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

The arrangement of the cellsfor search is given in the appendix. This derived cell saves computation andmemory overhead. A weight sharing strategy [46] among same operations withthe same originating node i to all nodes i < j < Nhas been applied within a cell.This is motivated by the observation that non-parametric operations operatingon the representation of a node produce the same feature map irrespective of theoutput node and thereby extended to parametric operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #2, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Onlythe orange stages are searchable in the encoder and classifier.the classification performance improves by 1.7%, yet the denoising performanceplateaus. LPIENet denoises the worst. Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations. Bottom: Shows the networkcomprising the normal cell (bold border) and reduction cells (dotted border) with train-able architecture parameters (red border) and the derived cells (green border) withoutany architecture parameters.Fig. 2: Demonstrates the calculation of memory size of a single cell in the architectureduring - Left: search phase. Right: evaluation phaseusing a cosine scheduler. Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36. The target-net is trained for 600 epochs with a batchsize of 96, optimizedusing SGD with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 3e-4, and gradient clippingof 5. The initial learning rate is set to 0.025 and gradually reduced to zero usinga cosine scheduler. Additional settings include a cutout length of 16, dropoutrate of 0.2, and use of an auxiliary head. For Imagenet-1k, We reduce the inputsize from 224 \xd7 224 to 28 \xd7 28 using three convolution layers with a stride of 2.The super-net for search has 8 cells starting with 16 channels, and the target-netfor evaluation has 14 cells starting with 48 channels. Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36. The target-net is trained for 600 epochs with a batchsize of 96, optimizedusing SGD with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 3e-4, and gradient clippingof 5. The initial learning rate is set to 0.025 and gradually reduced to zero usinga cosine scheduler. Additional settings include a cutout length of 16, dropoutrate of 0.2, and use of an auxiliary head. For Imagenet-1k, We reduce the inputsize from 224 \xd7 224 to 28 \xd7 28 using three convolution layers with a stride of 2.The super-net for search has 8 cells starting with 16 channels, and the target-netfor evaluation has 14 cells starting with 48 channels. Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The\ncombination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances\ncompression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with\nnumber of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy. The deployment\nof the final compressed model on edge device demonstrates high accuracy 92.5%\nand low inference time 20 ms, validating the effectiveness of compression\ntechniques for real-world edge computing applications.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-02\narXiv paper ID: 2409.02134v1\n\nTitle: Learning-based Compression for Material and Texture Recognition\nSummary: Learning-based image compression was shown to achieve a competitive\nperformance with state-of-the-art transform-based codecs. This motivated the\ndevelopment of new learning-based visual compression standards such as JPEG-AI.\nOf particular interest to these emerging standards is the development of\nlearning-based image compression systems targeting both humans and machines.\nThis paper is concerned with learning-based compression schemes whose\ncompressed-domain representations can be utilized to perform visual processing\nand computer vision tasks directly in the compressed domain. Such a\ncharacteristic has been incorporated as part of the scope and requirements of\nthe new emerging JPEG-AI standard. In our work, we adopt the learning-based\nJPEG-AI framework for performing material and texture recognition using the\ncompressed-domain latent representation at varing bit-rates. For comparison,\nperformance results are presented using compressed but fully decoded images in\nthe pixel domain as well as original uncompressed images. The obtained\nperformance results show that even though decoded images can degrade the\nclassification performance of the model trained with original images,\nretraining the model with decoded images will largely reduce the performance\ngap for the adopted texture dataset. It is also shown that the\ncompressed-domain classification can yield a competitive performance in terms\nof Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy while using a smaller reduced-complexity\nclassification model.\nPublication Date: 2021-04-16\narXiv paper ID: 2104.10065v1\n\nTitle: ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge\nSummary: In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across\nvarious industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management.\nEdge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and\nprovides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users\nusing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC).\nHowever, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand\nsubstantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime.\nThis makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge\nenvironments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian\nBridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new\nTSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first\nadaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus\ncapturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the\nclassification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication\ndata between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the\ndevelopment of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our\nsolution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series\nclassification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up\nto 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification.\nWhereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression\nratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-14\narXiv paper ID: 2410.10285v2\n\nTitle: A Perspective on Deep Vision Performance with Standard Image and Video Codecs\nSummary: Resource-constrained hardware, such as edge devices or cell phones, often\nrely on cloud servers to provide the required computational resources for\ninference in deep vision models. However, transferring image and video data\nfrom an edge or mobile device to a cloud server requires coding to deal with\nnetwork constraints. The use of standardized codecs, such as JPEG or H.264, is\nprevalent and required to ensure interoperability. This paper aims to examine\nthe implications of employing standardized codecs within deep vision pipelines.\nWe find that using JPEG and H.264 coding significantly deteriorates the\naccuracy across a broad range of vision tasks and models. For instance, strong\ncompression rates reduce semantic segmentation accuracy by more than 80% in\nmIoU. In contrast to previous findings, our analysis extends beyond image and\naction classification to localization and dense prediction tasks, thus\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-18\narXiv paper ID: 2404.12330v1\n\nTitle: AI Multi-Tenancy on Edge: Concurrent Deep Learning Model Executions and Dynamic Model Placements on Edge Devices\nSummary: Many real-world applications are widely adopting the edge computing paradigm\ndue to its low latency and better privacy protection. With notable success in\nAI and deep learning (DL), edge devices and AI accelerators play a crucial role\nin deploying DL inference services at the edge of the Internet. While prior\nworks quantified various edge devices' efficiency, most studies focused on the\nperformance of edge devices with single DL tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent\nneed to investigate AI multi-tenancy on edge devices, required by many advanced\nDL applications for edge computing.\n  This work investigates two techniques - concurrent model executions and\ndynamic model placements - for AI multi-tenancy on edge devices. With image\nclassification as an example scenario, we empirically evaluate AI multi-tenancy\non various edge devices, AI accelerators, and DL frameworks to identify its\nbenefits and limitations. Our results show that multi-tenancy significantly\nimproves DL inference throughput by up to 3.3x -- 3.8x on Jetson TX2. These AI\nmulti-tenancy techniques also open up new opportunities for flexible deployment\nof multiple DL services on edge devices and AI accelerators.\nPublication Date: 2021-07-26\narXiv paper ID: 2107.12486v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge AI model compression for image classification\n```.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Right: evaluation phaseusing a cosine scheduler. Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36. The target-net is trained for 600 epochs with a batchsize of 96, optimizedusing SGD with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 3e-4, and gradient clippingof 5. The initial learning rate is set to 0.025 and gradually reduced to zero usinga cosine scheduler. Additional settings include a cutout length of 16, dropoutrate of 0.2, and use of an auxiliary head. For Imagenet-1k, We reduce the inputsize from 224 \xd7 224 to 28 \xd7 28 using three convolution layers with a stride of 2.The super-net for search has 8 cells starting with 16 channels, and the target-netfor evaluation has 14 cells starting with 48 channels. Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters.

This motivated the\ndevelopment of new learning-based visual compression standards such as JPEG-AI.\nOf particular interest to these emerging standards is the development of\nlearning-based image compression systems targeting both humans and machines.\nThis paper is concerned with learning-based compression schemes whose\ncompressed-domain representations can be utilized to perform visual processing\nand computer vision tasks directly in the compressed domain. Such a\ncharacteristic has been incorporated as part of the scope and requirements of\nthe new emerging JPEG-AI standard. In our work, we adopt the learning-based\nJPEG-AI framework for performing material and texture recognition using the\ncompressed-domain latent representation at varing bit-rates. For comparison,\nperformance results are presented using compressed but fully decoded images in\nthe pixel domain as well as original uncompressed images. The obtained\nperformance results show that even though decoded images can degrade the\nclassification performance of the model trained with original images,\nretraining the model with decoded images will largely reduce the performance\ngap for the adopted texture dataset. It is also shown that the\ncompressed-domain classification can yield a competitive performance in terms\nof Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy while using a smaller reduced-complexity\nclassification model.\nPublication Date: 2021-04-16\narXiv paper ID: 2104.10065v1\n\nTitle: ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge\nSummary: In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across\nvarious industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management.\nEdge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and\nprovides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users\nusing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC).\nHowever, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand\nsubstantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime.\nThis makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge\nenvironments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian\nBridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new\nTSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first\nadaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus\ncapturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the\nclassification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication\ndata between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the\ndevelopment of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our\nsolution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series\nclassification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up\nto 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification.\nWhereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression\nratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-14\narXiv paper ID: 2410.10285v2\n\nTitle: A Perspective on Deep Vision Performance with Standard Image and Video Codecs\nSummary: Resource-constrained hardware, such as edge devices or cell phones, often\nrely on cloud servers to provide the required computational resources for\ninference in deep vision models. However, transferring image and video data\nfrom an edge or mobile device to a cloud server requires coding to deal with\nnetwork constraints. The use of standardized codecs, such as JPEG or H.264, is\nprevalent and required to ensure interoperability. This paper aims to examine\nthe implications of employing standardized codecs within deep vision pipelines.\nWe find that using JPEG and H.264 coding significantly deteriorates the\naccuracy across a broad range of vision tasks and models. For instance, strong\ncompression rates reduce semantic segmentation accuracy by more than 80% in\nmIoU. In contrast to previous findings, our analysis extends beyond image and\naction classification to localization and dense prediction tasks, thus\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-18\narXiv paper ID: 2404.12330v1\n\nTitle: AI Multi-Tenancy on Edge: Concurrent Deep Learning Model Executions and Dynamic Model Placements on Edge Devices\nSummary: Many real-world applications are widely adopting the edge computing paradigm\ndue to its low latency and better privacy protection. With notable success in\nAI and deep learning (DL), edge devices and AI accelerators play a crucial role\nin deploying DL inference services at the edge of the Internet. While prior\nworks quantified various edge devices' efficiency, most studies focused on the\nperformance of edge devices with single DL tasks.

I NTRODUCTIONEDGE devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) are becom-ing increasingly important and widely used in our dailylives and industrial facilities. IoT is a network of things thatempowered by sensors, identifiers, software intelligence, andinternet connectivity, it can be considered as the intersectionof the internet, things/objects (anything/everything), and data[1]. The number of these devices is expected to increase evenmore [2]. These devices have the potential to perform complexArtificial Intelligence (AI) tasks locally, without relying heav-ily on cloud infrastructure [3]. The rapid advancement of AIhas led to the development of complex deep learning modelsthat show high performance in different domains. DeployingAI models on edge devices has many advantages such as lowlatency, privacy and data security, bandwidth optimization, andreduced network dependence. Low latency is achieved due toreal-time processing by instant data analysis on edge withoutwaiting for remote server processing, this data analysis on theedge reduces transmitting data to the cloud which enhancessecurity against breaches, reduces the bandwidth consumption,and reduces network dependence.Samer Francy is with the Department of Computer Science, University ofBath, Bath, England (e-mail: samer.francy@bath.edu).Raghubir Singh is with the Department of Computer Science, Universityof Bath, Bath, England (e-mail: rs3022@bath.ac.uk).A. Overview of Edge AIEdge AI represents a paradigm shift in the way AI isimplemented in the context of the IoT. It capitalizes on thecapabilities of IoT devices, enhancing real-time processing,analytics, and decision-making directly at the edge of thenetwork. The IoT architecture, which is the foundation forEdge AI, typically involves three core layers [1]. The layersare perceptual layer, where data is collected from varioussensors and devices, network layer, where data is transmittedand routed through this layer, which is responsible for commu-nication between devices and cloud services, and applicationlayer, which processes and utilizes the data, providing insightsand enabling actions.B. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)CNN models are subsets of Deep Neural Networks (DNN)models. CNN models are effective for image and video-relatedtasks due to their ability to learn relevant features from thedata by recognizing patterns, shapes, and structures in images,which is challenging for traditional machine learning models,that\u2019s why they are used for computer vision tasks such asimage classification, object detection, and image segmentation[4].1) CNN Architecture: In general CNN models consist ofbelow parts:\u2022 Input Image : Pixels form the binary basis of computerimages, while the human visual system operates throughneurons with receptive fields. Similarly, CNNs functionwithin their receptive areas, starting with simple patternsand advancing to more complex ones, making CNNs apromising tool for computer vision [4].\u2022 Convolutional Layer : A convolutional layer in a CNNuses a small filter (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) that slides over theinput image. At each position, it multiplies its valueswith the overlapping image pixels and sums the results toproduce an output. This sliding operation helps identifylocal features like edges and colors, building a hierar-chical representation. The depth of the filter matches theinput image\u2019s channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images). Stackingmultiple filters allows the network to learn features atdifferent abstraction levels [4].\u2022 Pooling Layer : Pooling reduces the spatial size of fea-ture maps. This not only lowers computational demandsbut also helps in extracting position and orientation-independent features essential for training. Two com-mon pooling methods are maximum pooling and averagepooling. In maximum pooling, a small kernel (e.g., 2x2)arXiv:2409.02134v1  [cs.LG]  2 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2Fig. 1. Unbalanced Demand For Computation (Left) and Memory (Right) in AlexNet [5].selects the maximum value within its range and places itin the output. In average pooling, a similar-sized kernelcomputes the average value within its area for eachchannel, maintaining the same depth. Pooling simplifiescomputation and weight requirements, with maximumpooling being the most commonly used method [4].\u2022 Activation Function : The activation function, applies amathematical operation to the filter\u2019s output to concludethe output of the network. The common choice is the Rec-tified Linear Unit (ReLU). They fall into two categories,linear and non-linear activation functions [4].\u2022 Fully Connected Layer : It functions as a feed-forwardneural network (NN) typically situated at the network\u2019slower layers. It receives input from the output of the lastpooling or convolutional layer, which is flattened into aone-dimensional vector, enabling it to learn complex datarelationships [4].2) Computation and Memory Demands: In CNNs, unbal-ance exists in resource demands between the layers. Convolu-tional layers primarily serve as feature extractors and heavilydominate the computational workload. In the case of AlexNet,for instance, the convolutional layers account for just 2 millionweights but demand a substantial 1.33 Giga Operations PerSecond (GOPS) of computation. In contrast, fully connectedlayers function as classifiers, accumulating information forhigh-level decisions, and bear the weight of the network witharound 59 million parameters, yet they contribute significantlyless to computation, requiring only 0.12 GOPS. This obviouscontrast in resource allocation (Figure 1) highlights the unbal-anced demands between these two layers in CNNs [5].3) Key CNN Architectures:In 1989, the use of a NN archi-tecture with convolutional layers for recognizing handwrittendigits in the context of ZIP code recognition was introduced[6], That architecture consisted of input layer, 3 hidden layers,and output layer. Since then, CNN models have developed(Figure 2) and became much deeper.4) CNN on Edge: Deploying CNN models on edge hasa wide range of practical and industrial applications acrossvarious sectors. Here are some specific examples:\u2022 Surveillance and Security : It can perform real-time ob-ject detection and facial recognition for security monitor-ing, identifying intruders, and managing access control.Face identification was deployed using VGGFace [7].Video analysis was deployed using YOLOX [8]. Infraredand Visible Image Fusion for security systems was de-ployed using DenseNet [9]. Human action recognitionapplications were deployed using ResNet [10].\u2022 Manufacturing and Quality Control : It can inspectproducts on assembly lines for defects, ensuring qualitycontrol and minimizing errors. Real-time detection ofsteel strip surface defects was deployed using Faster R-CNN model [11].\u2022 Agriculture: Drones can monitor crops, detect pests,diseases, and nutrient deficiencies, enabling precisionagriculture. Identifying rice leaf diseases in natural en-vironments was deployed using GoogLeNet [12]. Pepperleaf disease identification was deployed using GoogLeNet[13]. Detection for insect pests was deployed on YOLOX[14].\u2022 Healthcare and Wearables : Wearable devices can con-tinuously monitor vital signs, detect anomalies, and evendiagnose certain health conditions. Medical diagnosis(Covid and Lung Disease Detection) was deployed usingVGG, MobileNet, and AlexNet [15]. Automatically diag-nose pneumonia and COVID-19 from chest X-ray imageswas deployed on DenseNet [16]. Medical applications(e.g., COVID-19 detection, cardiomegaly diagnosis, braintumor classification) were deployed using ResNet [10].\u2022 Energy Management: It can monitor energy usage, opti-mize consumption patterns, and identify areas for energyefficiency improvements. Wind Turbine Maintenance andfault diagnosis was deployed using AlexNet [17].\u2022 Environmental Monitoring : It can monitor air quality,pollution levels, and weather conditions, providing valu-able insights for urban planning. A smartphone app toperform fine-grained classification of animals in the wildwas deployed using AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet[18]. Identification of mosquito species was deployedusing AlexNet, DenseNet, Inception, ResNet, and VGG[19].--- Page 3 ---3Fig. 2. Evolution of Key CNN Architectures Over Time.\u2022 Logistics and Inventory Management : It can automatepackage sorting, inventory tracking, and warehouse man-agement. Mobile robot to map its surroundings while de-tecting objects and people was deployed using AlexNet,GoogLeNet, and ResNet [18].\u2022 Autonomous Vehicles : Vehicles can process real-timedata from cameras and sensors using CNNs, aiding inautonomous navigation and collision avoidance. Instanceobjects detection system for intelligent service robots wasdeployed using Alexnet [20]. Advanced driving assistancesystems (ADASs) and automated vehicles (A Vs) weredeployed using Faster R-CNN [21].Deploying CNNs on edge devices presents significant chal-lenges mainly due to the limited computational resources,constrained memory, and power consumption constraints in-herent to these devices. CNN models, known for their depthand complexity, often demand substantial computational powerand memory, which may exceed the capabilities of edgehardware. Hence, compressing the model before deploymentbecomes imperative. Model compression techniques aim toreduce the size of the CNN model while preserving its perfor-mance, thereby enabling efficient utilization of computationalresources and memory on edge devices. By compressingthe model, we can mitigate the challenges associated withdeploying CNNs on edge devices, ensuring that they caneffectively perform tasks such as real-time image processing,object detection, and classification within resource-constrainedenvironments.With the enormous number of compression techniques pro-posed for CNNs, the rapid evolution of CNN architectures hascreated a gap in the field. This dynamic shift in architecturedesign requires an evaluation of existing compression methods,particularly in light of the demand to make these advancedCNN models suitable for deployment on edge devices. AsCNN designs continue to advance, the challenge lies inadapting compression techniques to smoothly integrate withthese modern architectures. This evaluation (either for eachindividual techniques or combined with each other) becomesimportant, as it not only ensures the continued relevance ofcompression techniques but also addresses the urgent need tomake resource-intensive CNN models accessible and deploy-able on edge devices.This work aims to evaluate CNN compression techniquesthat assure appropriate performance on edge devices. In thesubsequent sections, this work reveals in a structured mannerto evaluate the compression techniques for CNN models.section 2 provides a detailed review of related work, offeringinsights into prior research and establishing a foundationalunderstanding of the topic. section 3 explains the methodologyemployed in conducting the experiments, describing the designand execution of the study. Following this, section 4 presentsthe experimental results and analyzes the findings to recognizetrends and implications. Section 5 critically evaluates the re-sults. Section 6 draws conclusions regarding the effectivenessand significance of the compression techniques. This organizedframework aims to comprehensively explore and contribute tothe field of model compression for efficient deployment inresource-constrained environments.II. R ELATED WORKWithin the context of edge AI, it is important to address thecritical need for model compression. The resource constrainednature of these devices requires more efficient AI modelsby minimizing memory and computational demands, ensur-ing faster inference speeds, and enhancing energy efficiency.Below will explore various model compression techniques andtheir implications for edge AI applications.A. PruningPruning is a key technique in DNN, aimed at enhancingefficiency and model generalization. It involves the removalof redundant components, such as parameters, neurons, filters,or entire layers, leading to several advantages. By reducingunnecessary parameters, it cuts down on storage require-ments, and important for models deployed on devices withlimited memory. Furthermore, it streamlines computational--- Page 4 ---4Fig. 3. Weight Pruning (a) and Neuron Pruning (b). x: input, w: weight. [22].complexity during inference, resulting in faster predictions andlower power consumption. Pruning also mitigates overfittingby simplifying the network. Various pruning techniques, likeweight pruning, neuron pruning, filter pruning, and layerpruning, offer different levels of granularity in componentremoval. Whether applied during or after training, pruningenables the creation of more compact and efficient CNNmodels tailored to specific needs, effectively balancing modelsize, computational efficiency, and accuracy. Weight pruningsets weight connections in the network to zero if they fallbelow a predefined threshold or are considered redundant.Neuron pruning focuses on removing entire neurons if they arefound to be redundant. Layer pruning allows for the removalof entire layers that are considered less important [22].1) Pruning For Fully Connected Layer: Fully connectedlayers are dense that makes the layer with high memorydemand. Pruning them effectively reduces the memory burdenand reduce size of the model.It involves selectively removing weight connections andneurons to reduce the model\u2019s complexity while preservingperformance. In a typical feed-forward NN, inputs are multi-plied by corresponding weights, and a linear sum is computedat each neuron, which is then transformed by an activationfunction. As shown in Figure 3, a network with 3 inputneurons, 2 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron may havemultiple weight connections. Pruning can be applied to elim-inate specific weight connections or entire neurons. By doingso, the total number of weight connections can be significantlyreduced, leading to a more compact network. The concept ofpruning was first introduced by [6], who proposed removingweights based on their saliency, with small-magnitude weightshaving less impact on training error. The process involvesiterative retraining to regain accuracy, and the technique isknown as \u2019Optimal Brain Damage (OBD)\u2019 where the secondderivative of the objective function with respect to parametersis used to calculate the small saliency, facilitating informedpruning decisions. Since then, other pruning approaches havebeen introduced for fully connected layers [22].2) Pruning For Convolutional Layer: Each convolutionallayer typically consists of numerous filters that makes the layerwith high computational demand. Pruning these less significantfilters directly from the convolutional layer effectively reducesthe computational burden and speeds up the model. Inspired byearly pruning methods, new approaches have been introducedto be used to prune convolutional layers [22].Bayesian was used to decide what to prune and the level ofpruning, in this context involves employing scale mixtures ofnormals as priors for parameter weights in LeNet and VGG[23]. Differential evolution based layer-wise weight methodalongside three other pruning techniques (Naive Cut, Itera-tive Pruning, and Multi-Objective NN Pruning) was used toprune LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 [24]. Two fully connectedlayers are removed from the AlexNet architecture, and BatchNormalization (BN) is introduced to mitigate overfitting [20].Filters Similarity in Consecutive Layers (FSCL) for CNNs wasused to reduce the number of filters while preserving impor-tant filters, ultimately improving model efficiency for VGG,GoogLeNet, and ResNet [25]. Structured pruning throughsparsity-induced pruning was used to enhance the real-timeimplementation of the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) [26].Structured pruning was used to compress YOLOX, this processincluded sparse training to prune unimportant channels, withfine-tuning to recover accuracy [14]. Evolutionary approachto filter pruning involved sequential application of multiplepruners in a specific order to sparsify LeNet and VGG-19while maintaining model accuracy [27]. Multilayer networkswere used to represent and compress ResNets, it involvedcreating class networks, calculating arc weights, and forminga multilayer network. The overall degree of nodes in themultilayer network is used to select a subset of nodes forcompression, and convolutional layers are pruned [10]. Tooptimize the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny model for efficient detec-tion of COVID-19 and pneumonia in chest X-ray images,three steps were implemented including removing insignif-icant weights, discarding pruning casings, and applying acompression algorithm [16]. Deep Scalable Zerotree-based(DeepSZ) framework was used to address resource constraints--- Page 5 ---5by achieving significant compression for LeNet, AlexNet,and VGG while maintaining acceptable inference accuracy[28]. Compressing without retraining that was used withResNet, AlexNet, VGGNet and SqueezeNet. It focused onconvolutional and fully connected layers, while maintainingor improving classification accuracy [29].B. QuantizationQuantization plays an important role in addressing theresource-intensive nature of CNNs. By reducing the bit pre-cision of model parameters, quantization not only conservesmemory and energy but also enhances inference speed, makingit an essential technique for deploying CNNs in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. Weight clus-tering takes quantization to a more advanced level by orga-nizing weights into clusters, where each cluster shares thesame weight value. This approach minimizes the need forfine-tuning individual weights and can lead to substantialreductions in memory and computational overhead [22].Single Level Quantization (SLQ) and Multiple Level Quan-tization (MLQ) technique were used to quantize AlexNet,VGG, GoogleNet, and ResNet to the deployment of thesemodels on resource-constrained mobile devices like mobilephones and drones [30].C. Low-Rank Decomposition/FactorizationIt is a compression technique used with feed-forward NNsand CNNs, to reduce the size of weight matrices whilepreserving model performance. Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is a popular factorization scheme that decomposes aweight matrix A into three smaller matrices: U, S, and V T . Urepresents the left singular vectors, S is a diagonal matrix ofsingular values, and V T is the transpose of the right singularvectors. This factorization offers several advantages, such asreduced storage requirements, which is crucial for memory-constrained environments, and accelerated inference, espe-cially in CNNs, as smaller matrices can be convolved faster.Low-rank factorization can be applied to fully connected andconvolutional layers, making models more storage-efficientand faster without sacrificing performance. Careful selectionof the rank is essential for achieving a balance between sizereduction and model accuracy. Later, more approaches havebeen introduced [22].Tucker decomposition for weight tensors was used tooptimizes weight tensor dimensions of LeNet and ResNetmodels [31]. Low-rank decomposition was used as an efficientmethod for compressing AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet withoutthe need for fine-tuning to significantly reduce model sizeand computational complexity to make them more suitablefor resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices [32].Hardware-Aware Automatic Low-Rank Compression frame-work HALOC was used to compress ResNet, VGG andMobileNet, with the goal of efficiently exploring the structure-level redundancy in NNs by integrating principles from neuralarchitecture search (NAS) [33]. Automatically DifferentiableTensor Network (ADTN) method was used to significantlyreduce the number of parameters of fully connected NN,LeNet, and VGG while maintaining or enhancing the per-formance [34]. Joint Matrix Decomposition, specifically JointSVD (JSVD) was used to address the challenge of deployingResNet with numerous parameters on resource-constrainedplatforms. It included Right JSVD, Left JSVD, and BinaryJSVD algorithms [35]. Tensor Ring Networks (TR-Nets) wasused as a method to effectively factorize LeNet and ResNet,thereby reducing computational and memory requirements[36]. Tucker decomposition with rank selection and fine tuningwas used as a one-shot whole network compression schemefor deploying AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet on mobiledevices while maintaining reasonable accuracy [37]. TensorDynamic Low-Rank Training (TDLRT) was used to createa training algorithm with VGG and AlexNet that maintainshigh model performance while significantly reducing memoryrequirements for convolutional layers [38].D. Knowledge Distillation (KD)It is a technique used to transfer the knowledge learnedby a larger, more complex model (the teacher model) to asmaller and lighter model (the student model). The primarygoal of KD is to enable the student model to benefit from thegeneralization capabilities of the teacher model while beingmore lightweight in terms of parameters and computations.This technique helps to recover the accuracy drop occurs dueto implementing other compression techniques.Knowledge transfer and distillation, initially introduced by[39], aimed to compress large ensemble models into smaller,faster counterparts with minimal performance loss. [40] ex-tended this concept by empirically demonstrating that theintricate knowledge within larger DNNs could be effectivelytransferred to smaller, shallower models, yielding comparableaccuracy. This involved training a large DNN and transfer-ring its knowledge to a shallower network while minimizingthe squared difference between the logits produced by thetwo models. These foundational ideas produced knowledgedistillation, a widely used technique for training efficientmodels by transferring knowledge from larger ones. Later,more approaches have been introduced [22].KD was used to improve the compression of LeNet andResNet models when fresh training data is scarce, primarilythrough the use of synthetic data generated by GenerativeAdversarial Networks (GANs) [41]. To fuse information frominfrared and visible images while reducing DenseNet complex-ity and improving inference speed. Insights from pre-trainedteacher models are transferred to the smaller student model[9]. KD was used to develop a lightweight mosquito speciesidentification model (EfficientNet) that balances efficiency andaccuracy through the compression [42].E. Mixed TechniquesDifferent compression techniques are often combined andused together to achieve more effective and comprehensivemodel compression. Each compression technique targets spe-cific aspects of the model, such as reducing model size,computation complexity, or memory footprint.--- Page 6 ---6In-Parallel Pruning-Quantization CLIP-Q method combinesnetwork pruning and weight quantization was used to com-press AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet [18]. Pruning andquantization were used to optimize the compression ofAlexNet and reduce the number of parameters significantlywhile maintaining accuracy to be implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) [5]. Pruning, quantization,and Huffman encoding combined with adversarial trainingwere used to enhance the robustness and compression ofAlexNet while also addressing the model vulnerability toadversarial attacks [43]. Pruning and quantization were usedto compress VGG and ResNet for remote sensing imageclassification, balancing computational complexity constraintswhile preserving model accuracy [44]. Low-rank decompo-sition and quantization were used to compress ResNet andMobileNet, and reduce the computational complexity whilepreserving high performance [45]. Pruning, quantization, andchanging the model architecture were used to design a com-pact SqueezeNet with competitive accuracy while significantlyreducing the number of parameters [46]. Quantization andpruning were used to develop an effective model compressionframework for ResNet and MobileNet. The objective was tooptimize the allocation of compression ratios to minimizeperformance degradation while reducing model size [47]. Jointquantization and pruning were used to develop a post-trainingmodel size compression method that efficiently combines lossyand lossless compression techniques to reduce the size ofResNet, MobileNet, RegNet, MNasNet, and YOLOv5 withoutsacrificing accuracy [48].F . Other TechniquesDepthwise separable convolutions was used to improvesteel strip defect detection by creating a real-time and ef-ficient model while maintaining high accuracy using FasterR-CNN [11]. Deferential Evolution was used to develop anefficient and optimized AlexNet, VGG, and MobileNet forCovid and liver disease detection [15]. Genetic Algorithmwas used to reduce the storage space and inference timeof VGG, ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet models [49].Factorization (changing kernel size) was used to improvethe accuracy and computing efficiency of pepper leaf diseasedetection using GoogLeNet, specifically for the agriculturalindustry [13]. Flexible and Separable Convolution (FSConv)was used to reduce computational costs without compromisingthe accuracy of VGG, ResNet, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet[50]. Efficient Layer Compression (ELC) was used to enhancethe computational efficiency of VGG, ResNet, and ConvNeXtwhile preserving their representation capabilities [51].III. D ESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENTSThe experiments aimed to evaluate various compressiontechniques, namely pruning and quantization, on differenttypes of ConvNext [52] model. The experiments includedtraining, fine-tuning, and evaluating of models using CIFAR-10 dataset. The setup involved conducting experiments bothon cloud-based platforms and on edge devices to evaluate theperformance of the compressed models.Fig. 4. Block modifications and resulted specifications. (a) is a ResNeXtblock; in (b) we create an inverted bottleneck block and in (c) the positionof the spatial depthwise conv layer is moved up [52].A. ConvNeXt [52]Is a modern CNN family produced as a journey of graduallymodernize a standard ResNet toward the design of a visionTransformer. The journey starts from a ResNet-50 model, intoa CNN architecture that mirrors some aspects of Transformers,particularly Swin Transformers. The roadmap:1) Training Techniques: Vision Transformer training pro-cedures were used to train ResNet-50 model, this includedextending the training to 300 epochs (90 epochs originally),using AdamW optimizer, and data augmentation techniques(Mixup, Cutmix, RandAugment, Random Erasing, and regu-larization schemes including Stochastic Depth).2) Macro Design: Number of blocks in each stage wasadjusted from (3, 4, 6, 3) to (3, 3, 9, 3) and the stem wasreplaced with a patchify layer implemented using a 4x4, stride4 convolutional layer (non-overlapping convolution).3) ResNeXt-ify: ResNeXt approach was adopted which isutilize grouped convolutions, where convolutional filters aredivided into groups, each handling a subset of input channels,a variation of grouped convolution known as depthwise convo-lution was adopted, and the network\u2019s width was expanded byincreasing the number of channels in the convolutional layers.4) Inverted Bottleneck: The hidden dimension of the MLPblock was changed to be four times wider than the inputdimension as shown in Figure 4 (a and b)5) Large Kernel Sizes: The position of the convolutionallayer is moved up and the kernel size was changed from (3x3)to (7x7) as shown in Figure 4 (a and c).B. Micro DesignReplacing ReLU with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU),fewer normalization layers, Substituting Batch Normalization(BN) with Layer Normalization (LN), and introducing separatedownsampling layers as shown in Figure 5.C. Compression Techniques1) Pruning: Different pruning techniques have been usedincluding structured and unstructured techniques.\u2022 Only Train Once (OTO) [53]: OTO version 3 (OTOV3)is automated framework for structured pruning which in-volves removing entire structures or groups of parametersfrom a DNN. OTOv3 begins by analyzing the depen-dencies between the vertices of the target DNN. Thisanalysis involves identifying accessory, Shape-Dependent--- Page 7 ---7Fig. 5. Block designs for a ResNet, a Swin Transformer, and a ConvNeXt.Swin Transformer\u2019s block is more sophisticated due to the presence of multiplespecialized modules and two residual connections [52].(SD) joint, and unknown vertices that are adjacent andestablishing their interdependencies. The goal is to formnode groups based on these dependencies, laying thefoundation for identifying interdependent vertices duringstructured pruning.Using the information gathered from the dependencyanalysis, OTOv3 constructs a pruning dependency graph.This graph represents the interdependencies between ver-tices, with vertices in the same node group indicatingtheir interdependency during structured pruning. Thepruning dependency graph ensures the validity of theproduced subnetwork by preserving essential connectionsbetween vertices.OTOv3 partitions the trainable variables of the DNNinto Pruning Zero-Invariant Groups (PZIGs) based on thepruning dependency graph. PZIGs consist of pairwisetrainable variables grouped together, with each grouprepresenting a potential pruning structure. Node groupsadjacent to the DNN output and containing unknownvertices are excluded from forming PZIGs to preserveoutput shapes and ensure model robustness as shown inFigure 6.To jointly search for redundant pruning structures andtrain the remaining groups for optimal performance,OTOv3 employs the Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient(DHSPG) algorithm. DHSPG minimizes the objectivefunction while introducing a sparsity constraint to identifyredundant groups for removal. It employs saliency-drivenredundant identification and a hybrid training paradigmto control sparsity and achieve better generalization per-formance as shown in Figure 7.\u2022 L1 Unstructured [54] L1 unstructured pruning is atechnique used in machine learning, to reduce the sizeof neural networks by eliminating less important con-nections. Each weight in the network is assigned a scorebased on its magnitude. This score reflects the importanceof the weight in the network\u2019s performance. In l1 pruning,this score is often the absolute value of the weight.A threshold is set, typically by selecting the top x% ofweights based on their magnitude scores. The thresholddetermines which weights will be pruned and which willbe retained.Weights that fall below the threshold are pruned, meaningthey are set to zero and effectively removed from thenetwork. This results in a sparser network architecturewith fewer connections.\u2022 Random Unstructured [55] Similar to l1 unstructuredpruning, random unstructured pruning is also a techniqueused in machine learning, to reduce the size of neuralnetworks by eliminating less important connections. Thedifference is the pruned weight are selected randomlyinstead of using l1 to decide the importance of theweights.2) Dynamic Quantization [30]:Dynamic quantization is anapproach aimed at optimizing the deployment of neural net-works by reducing the precision of the weights. Unlike tradi-tional quantization methods that apply a fixed quantization bit-width across all layers of the network, dynamic quantizationadapts the quantization bit-width for each layer individuallybased on its representation abilities and capacities. This isachieved through the use of a bit-width controller module,which employs a policy gradient-based training approach tolearn the optimal bit-width for each layer. By dynamicallyadjusting the quantization bit-width, dynamic quantization canstrike a balance between maintaining accuracy and reducingmemory size and computational costs.D. CIFAR-10 [56]CIFAR-10 is a dataset used for computer vision and ma-chine learning research, offering a rich resource for trainingand evaluating image classification algorithms. Comprising60,000 32x32 RGB color images across 10 distinct classes(Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse,Ship, and Truck), CIFAR-10 facilitates comprehensive explo-ration of diverse visual concepts. With each class containing6,000 images and a balanced distribution across the dataset,CIFAR-10 presents a well-structured foundation for model de-velopment. Its division into 50,000 training images and 10,000test images, further segmented into multiple batches, enablesstrict evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms. In terms ofcomputational requirements, CIFAR-10 generally requires lesscomputation compared to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet due to itssmaller image size and fewer classes which makes it suitablefor experiments with limited computational resources.E. Experiment SetupTwo types of experiments have been conducted, cloud-basedexperiments that focused on compressing the models and eval-uating the techniques and edge-based experiment experimentto evaluate the performance of one of the compressed models.--- Page 8 ---8Fig. 6. Automated PZIG Partition [53].Fig. 7. Search Direction in DHSPG [53].1) Cloud-based Experiment Setup: Google Colab Pro+was used to utilize GPU resources (NVIDIA A100 and V100Tensor Core GPUs), facilitating accelerated model trainingand evaluation and background execution. The integrationwith Google Drive reduced overheads associated with upload-ing and downloading model data to and from cloud. Theevaluation framework was designed to profile the originalmodel, compress it, profile the compressed model, and conductcomparison between the measurements before and after thecompression as shown in Figure 8.This profiling process involved measuring several key met-rics:\u2022 Accuracy: The classification accuracy achieved by themodel on the validation dataset.\u2022 Model Size: The size of the model in megabytes (MB).\u2022 Number of Parameters : The total count of trainableparameters in the model, measured in millions (M).\u2022 Number of MACs : The number of multiply-accumulateoperations performed during inference, measured in mil-lions (M).\u2022 Number of Non-Zero Parameters : The count of non-zero parameters in the model, essential for pruning-basedtechniques.2) Edge-based Experiment Setup: A compressed modelwas deployed on edge with CPU (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz 2.80 GHz), RAM (16GB), and laptopintegrated camera.2 samples from each of CIFAR-10 classes have been se-lected randomly from the internet, printed on A4 papers, andplaced in front of the camera to measure the accuracy and theinference time.--- Page 9 ---9Fig. 8.

R UNNING THE EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIMENTALRESULTSA. Cloud-Base Experimentsdifferent experiments have been conducted on cloud to eval-uate different compressing techniques and different versions ofConvNeXt model.1) Evaluate OTOV3 on Untrained Torch ConvNext Tiny,Small, Base, and Large: Untrained ConvNeXt tiny, small,base, and large have been imported from Torch and beenused to evaluate OTOV3 which train and prune at the sametime, CIFAR-10 was used for training and evaluation, and 200epochs were used for training and pruning. OTOV3 achievedhigh performance (Table I) with reducing the model size(61% for tiny and 75% for small, base, and large), numberof parameters (61% for tiny and 75% for small, base, andlarge), and MACs (45% for tiny and 60% for small, base,and large) as shown in Figure 9. Meanwhile OTOV3 wasable to increase both the full and compressed model accuracythrough the training and pruning without any accuracy dropafter pruning comparing to the full model.To investigate the effect of OTOV3 on the model archi-tecture, a comparison has been conducted between ConvNeXtsmall before and after compression. The Torch implementationof the model consist of many CNBlocks, each CNBlock con-sist of Conv2d, Permute, LayerNorm, Linear, GELU, Linear,and Permute layers. As shown in Figure 10, OTOV3 reducednumber of output features of the Linear layer (sequence 3)and the input features of the next Linear layer (sequence 5)and considering the big number of CNBlock in the modelarchitecture, the reduction in model size and number ofparameters after compression is justified as shown in TableII.2) Evaluate OTOV3 on Untrained ConvNext Small (Torchvs. TIMM): Two untrained ConvNeXt small have been im-ported, one from Torch and one from TIMM [57] and beenused to evaluate OTOV3 which train and prune at the sametime, CIFAR-10 was used for training and evaluation, and200 epochs were used for training and pruning. Although thecompression performance was same with size reduction (75%)but the accuracy after 200 epochs was less for Torch model(63%) comparing to TIMM model (73%) as shown in Figure11.To investigate the accuracy performance of OTOV3 withTorch and Timm ConvNeXt Small, a comparison has beenconducted between the two model architectures. The Torchmodel uses the CNBlock structure, which includes additionaloperations such as Permute and varying StochasticDepth prob-abilities. The TIMM model follows a simpler structure withConv2d and LayerNorm, lacking the additional complexitiesintroduced by CNBlock and associated operations in theTorch model as shown in Figure 12 which effects OTOV3performance regarding the accuracy.3) Evaluate OTOV3 on Fine-Tuned Torch ConvNext Small:A pre-trained ConvNeXt small have been imported from Torchand fine-tuned on CIFAR-10 with 100 epochs, the accuracyreached 89.5%. This fine-tuned ConvNeXt small will be usedfor the rest of cloud-base experiments. This model was usedto evaluate OTOV3, CIFAR-10 was used for training andevaluation, and 200 epochs were used for training and pruning.OTOV3 achieved high performance (Table III) 74% reductionin model size and number of parameters, 60% reduction inMACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy as shown Figure13. The accuracy of the full model in (Table III) (92.86%)is different that the accuracy of the original model used inthe experiment (89.5%), that because OTOV3 trained the full--- Page 10 ---10Fig. 9.

OTOV3 Comparison Between Torch and Timm ConvNeXt Small.model during the process which increased the model accuracy.4) Evaluate Unstructured Pruning: The Fine-tuned Con-vNext Small was used to evaluate Pytorch L1 UnstructuredPruning and Random Unstructured Pruning by using differentcombinations of weights pruning percentages for linear (.1 to.9) and convolutional (.1 to .9) layers. In both experiments,the accuracy and the number of non-zero parameters weredropping as the values of weights pruning percentages for bothlinear and convolutional amounts were increasing as shown inFigure 14 a and b. Although the accuracy dropped but themodel size, number of parameters, and MACs didn\u2019t changeas these techniques zero the weights instead of removing them.5) Evaluate Dynamic Quantization: The Fine-tuned Con-vNext Small was used to evaluate Pytorch dynamic quantiza-tion, 8-bit integer was used during the experiment and CIFAR-10 was used for evaluation. Dynamic quantization achievedhigh performance (Table IV) 71% reduction in model size,95% reduction with number of parameters and MACs, and0.1% drop with accuracy as shown in Figure 156) Evaluate Combination of OTOV3 and Dynamic Quan-tization: Two compression stages were evaluated together asone compression pipeline, OTOV3 and Dynamic Quantization.The compressed ConvNeXt small model that was produced inexperiment 4.1.3 (OTOV3) was furtherly compressed using--- Page 11 ---11Fig. 12. Comparison Between ConvNeXt Small TIMM (Left) and Torch (Right).Fig. 13. OTOV3 Compression Performance with ConvNeXt Small Tuned.Pytorch dynamic quantization using 8-bits integer (similar toexperiment 4.1.5). The pruned models using OTOV2 [58]had dependencies on Open Nural Network Exchange (ONNX)[59] which made it not applicable to be combined with othercompression technique like quantization. In OTOv3, there wasengineering changes produced the pruned model directly inPytorch format, which enhanced the flexibility to be combinedwith quantization as this experiment did [53].Pruning using OTOV3 and Quantization using Pytorchdynamic quantization achieved high performance (Table V)89.7% reduction in model size, 95% reduction with numberof parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy asshown in 16.B. Edge-Base ExperimentThe final compressed ConvNeXt Small model in experimentIV .A.6 (OTV3 and Dynamic Quantization) was deployed onedge and the printed samples used to measure the accuracyand inference time by placing them in front of the camera.The compressed model achieved 92.5% accuracy and 20msinference time. Figure 17 shows samples of the output.V. A NALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSHere, the experimental results obtained from running aseries of experiments will be analyzed, the experiments aimedat evaluating various compression techniques applied to Con-vNeXt models. The experiments were designed to evaluate theperformance of techniques such as pruning and quantizationon different sizes of ConvNeXt models, with a focus on bothcloud-based compression experiments and edge-based deploy-ment experiment. The analysis will be conducted with respectto the work\u2019s aim of evaluating CNN compression techniquesthat assure appropriate performance (size and inference time)on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.A. OTOV3 Evaluation on Untrained ConvNeXt ModelsThe evaluation of OTOV3 on untrained ConvNeXt modelsdemonstrated its effectiveness in achieving substantial com-pression while increasing model accuracy for both full andcompressed models. Across varying sizes of ConvNeXt mod-els, OTOV3 consistently produced impressive reductions inmodel size, number of parameters, and MACs, highlighting itsability to prune redundant structures effectively.

Samples From the Compressed Model Output on Edge.that OTOV3 efficiently identifies and removes unnecessaryparameters from the models, leading to more streamlinedarchitectures without compromising predictive performance.However, an unexpected observation arose when comparingthe accuracy of the Torch implementation with that of theTIMM implementation of ConvNeXt Small. The Torch im-plementation exhibited lower accuracy compared to its TIMMcounterpart, indicating that OTOV3\u2019s performance regardingaccuracy may be influenced by the details of the modelarchitecture. This unexpected result suggests that differenttraining strategies or adjustments may be necessary to optimizeOTOV3\u2019s performance across various model implementations,emphasizing the importance of considering architectural dif-ferences when applying compression techniques like OTOV3.B. OTOV3 Evaluation on Fine-Tuned ConvNeXt ModelsWhen evaluating OTOV3\u2019s performance on a fine-tunedConvNeXt model, notable improvements in compression per-formance were observed, confirming its effectiveness in re-ducing model size, parameters, and MACs while marginallyenhancing accuracy. This outcome highlights the potential ofintegrating fine-tuning with structured pruning techniques toachieve even greater optimization of model performance. Thefine-tuned model displayed enhanced compression capabilitiescompared to untrained models, suggesting that pre-trainingcan significantly increase the effectiveness of compressiontechniques. This finding highlights the importance of lever-aging pre-existing knowledge within models to maximize thebenefits of compression, ultimately resulting in CNN modelswith higher performance.C. Unstructured Pruning TechniquesDuring the evaluation of l1 unstructured and random un-structured pruning techniques, expected trends were observedregarding accuracy and compression. As the pruning per-centages increased for both linear and convolutional layers,a corresponding decrease in accuracy was noted, while themodel size, parameters, and MACs remained unaltered. Thisoutcome aligns with the inherent nature of unstructured prun-ing, wherein weights are zeroed out but not entirely eliminated,resulting in sparse models without substantial reductions incomputational complexity. However, the lack of significantreductions in computational complexity may constrain their ef-fectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained environmentswhere efficient utilization of computational resources is essen-tial. This highlights the importance of considering the trade-offs between model compression and computational efficiencywhen selecting pruning techniques for deployment in real---- Page 14 ---14TABLE VIOTOV3 AND DYNAMIC QUANTIZATION REDUCTION NUMBERS WITH CONV NEXT SMALL TUNED .Technique AccuracyChange Size Reduction ParametersReductionMACsReductionOTOV3 3.75% 73.51% 73.62% 60.18%Dynamic Quantization -0.15% 71.30% 95.43% 95.71%OTOV3 and DynamicQuantization 3.80% 89.74% 95.43% 95.71%world applications, especially in edge computing scenarioswhere computational resources are limited.D.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2307.04443v1\n```\nStep #5, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge AI model compression for image classification\n```\nStep #6, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge AI model compression for image classification, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This motivated the\ndevelopment of new learning-based visual compression standards such as JPEG-AI.\nOf particular interest to these emerging standards is the development of\nlearning-based image compression systems targeting both humans and machines.\nThis paper is concerned with learning-based compression schemes whose\ncompressed-domain representations can be utilized to perform visual processing\nand computer vision tasks directly in the compressed domain. Such a\ncharacteristic has been incorporated as part of the scope and requirements of\nthe new emerging JPEG-AI standard. In our work, we adopt the learning-based\nJPEG-AI framework for performing material and texture recognition using the\ncompressed-domain latent representation at varing bit-rates. For comparison,\nperformance results are presented using compressed but fully decoded images in\nthe pixel domain as well as original uncompressed images. The obtained\nperformance results show that even though decoded images can degrade the\nclassification performance of the model trained with original images,\nretraining the model with decoded images will largely reduce the performance\ngap for the adopted texture dataset. It is also shown that the\ncompressed-domain classification can yield a competitive performance in terms\nof Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy while using a smaller reduced-complexity\nclassification model.\nPublication Date: 2021-04-16\narXiv paper ID: 2104.10065v1\n\nTitle: ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge\nSummary: In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across\nvarious industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management.\nEdge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and\nprovides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users\nusing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC).\nHowever, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand\nsubstantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime.\nThis makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge\nenvironments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian\nBridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new\nTSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first\nadaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus\ncapturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the\nclassification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication\ndata between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the\ndevelopment of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our\nsolution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series\nclassification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up\nto 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification.\nWhereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression\nratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-14\narXiv paper ID: 2410.10285v2\n\nTitle: A Perspective on Deep Vision Performance with Standard Image and Video Codecs\nSummary: Resource-constrained hardware, such as edge devices or cell phones, often\nrely on cloud servers to provide the required computational resources for\ninference in deep vision models. However, transferring image and video data\nfrom an edge or mobile device to a cloud server requires coding to deal with\nnetwork constraints. The use of standardized codecs, such as JPEG or H.264, is\nprevalent and required to ensure interoperability. This paper aims to examine\nthe implications of employing standardized codecs within deep vision pipelines.\nWe find that using JPEG and H.264 coding significantly deteriorates the\naccuracy across a broad range of vision tasks and models. For instance, strong\ncompression rates reduce semantic segmentation accuracy by more than 80% in\nmIoU. In contrast to previous findings, our analysis extends beyond image and\naction classification to localization and dense prediction tasks, thus\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-18\narXiv paper ID: 2404.12330v1\n\nTitle: AI Multi-Tenancy on Edge: Concurrent Deep Learning Model Executions and Dynamic Model Placements on Edge Devices\nSummary: Many real-world applications are widely adopting the edge computing paradigm\ndue to its low latency and better privacy protection. With notable success in\nAI and deep learning (DL), edge devices and AI accelerators play a crucial role\nin deploying DL inference services at the edge of the Internet. While prior\nworks quantified various edge devices' efficiency, most studies focused on the\nperformance of edge devices with single DL tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent\nneed to investigate AI multi-tenancy on edge devices, required by many advanced\nDL applications for edge computing.\n  This work investigates two techniques - concurrent model executions and\ndynamic model placements - for AI multi-tenancy on edge devices. With image\nclassification as an example scenario, we empirically evaluate AI multi-tenancy\non various edge devices, AI accelerators, and DL frameworks to identify its\nbenefits and limitations. Our results show that multi-tenancy significantly\nimproves DL inference throughput by up to 3.3x -- 3.8x on Jetson TX2. These AI\nmulti-tenancy techniques also open up new opportunities for flexible deployment\nof multiple DL services on edge devices and AI accelerators.\nPublication Date: 2021-07-26\narXiv paper ID: 2107.12486v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.02134v1\n```\nStep #7, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---1Edge AI: Evaluation of Model CompressionTechniques for Convolutional Neural NetworksSamer Francy, Member, IEEE,Raghubir Singh, Member, IEEEAbstract\u2014This work evaluates the compression techniqueson ConvNeXt models in image classification tasks using theCIFAR-10 dataset.

I NTRODUCTIONEDGE devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) are becom-ing increasingly important and widely used in our dailylives and industrial facilities. IoT is a network of things thatempowered by sensors, identifiers, software intelligence, andinternet connectivity, it can be considered as the intersectionof the internet, things/objects (anything/everything), and data[1]. The number of these devices is expected to increase evenmore [2]. These devices have the potential to perform complexArtificial Intelligence (AI) tasks locally, without relying heav-ily on cloud infrastructure [3]. The rapid advancement of AIhas led to the development of complex deep learning modelsthat show high performance in different domains. DeployingAI models on edge devices has many advantages such as lowlatency, privacy and data security, bandwidth optimization, andreduced network dependence. Low latency is achieved due toreal-time processing by instant data analysis on edge withoutwaiting for remote server processing, this data analysis on theedge reduces transmitting data to the cloud which enhancessecurity against breaches, reduces the bandwidth consumption,and reduces network dependence.Samer Francy is with the Department of Computer Science, University ofBath, Bath, England (e-mail: samer.francy@bath.edu).Raghubir Singh is with the Department of Computer Science, Universityof Bath, Bath, England (e-mail: rs3022@bath.ac.uk).A. Overview of Edge AIEdge AI represents a paradigm shift in the way AI isimplemented in the context of the IoT. It capitalizes on thecapabilities of IoT devices, enhancing real-time processing,analytics, and decision-making directly at the edge of thenetwork. The IoT architecture, which is the foundation forEdge AI, typically involves three core layers [1]. The layersare perceptual layer, where data is collected from varioussensors and devices, network layer, where data is transmittedand routed through this layer, which is responsible for commu-nication between devices and cloud services, and applicationlayer, which processes and utilizes the data, providing insightsand enabling actions.B. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)CNN models are subsets of Deep Neural Networks (DNN)models. CNN models are effective for image and video-relatedtasks due to their ability to learn relevant features from thedata by recognizing patterns, shapes, and structures in images,which is challenging for traditional machine learning models,that\u2019s why they are used for computer vision tasks such asimage classification, object detection, and image segmentation[4].1) CNN Architecture: In general CNN models consist ofbelow parts:\u2022 Input Image : Pixels form the binary basis of computerimages, while the human visual system operates throughneurons with receptive fields. Similarly, CNNs functionwithin their receptive areas, starting with simple patternsand advancing to more complex ones, making CNNs apromising tool for computer vision [4].\u2022 Convolutional Layer : A convolutional layer in a CNNuses a small filter (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) that slides over theinput image. At each position, it multiplies its valueswith the overlapping image pixels and sums the results toproduce an output. This sliding operation helps identifylocal features like edges and colors, building a hierar-chical representation. The depth of the filter matches theinput image\u2019s channels (e.g., 3 for RGB images). Stackingmultiple filters allows the network to learn features atdifferent abstraction levels [4].\u2022 Pooling Layer : Pooling reduces the spatial size of fea-ture maps. This not only lowers computational demandsbut also helps in extracting position and orientation-independent features essential for training. Two com-mon pooling methods are maximum pooling and averagepooling. In maximum pooling, a small kernel (e.g., 2x2)arXiv:2409.02134v1  [cs.LG]  2 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2Fig. 1. Unbalanced Demand For Computation (Left) and Memory (Right) in AlexNet [5].selects the maximum value within its range and places itin the output. In average pooling, a similar-sized kernelcomputes the average value within its area for eachchannel, maintaining the same depth. Pooling simplifiescomputation and weight requirements, with maximumpooling being the most commonly used method [4].\u2022 Activation Function : The activation function, applies amathematical operation to the filter\u2019s output to concludethe output of the network. The common choice is the Rec-tified Linear Unit (ReLU). They fall into two categories,linear and non-linear activation functions [4].\u2022 Fully Connected Layer : It functions as a feed-forwardneural network (NN) typically situated at the network\u2019slower layers. It receives input from the output of the lastpooling or convolutional layer, which is flattened into aone-dimensional vector, enabling it to learn complex datarelationships [4].2) Computation and Memory Demands: In CNNs, unbal-ance exists in resource demands between the layers. Convolu-tional layers primarily serve as feature extractors and heavilydominate the computational workload. In the case of AlexNet,for instance, the convolutional layers account for just 2 millionweights but demand a substantial 1.33 Giga Operations PerSecond (GOPS) of computation. In contrast, fully connectedlayers function as classifiers, accumulating information forhigh-level decisions, and bear the weight of the network witharound 59 million parameters, yet they contribute significantlyless to computation, requiring only 0.12 GOPS. This obviouscontrast in resource allocation (Figure 1) highlights the unbal-anced demands between these two layers in CNNs [5].3) Key CNN Architectures:In 1989, the use of a NN archi-tecture with convolutional layers for recognizing handwrittendigits in the context of ZIP code recognition was introduced[6], That architecture consisted of input layer, 3 hidden layers,and output layer. Since then, CNN models have developed(Figure 2) and became much deeper.4) CNN on Edge: Deploying CNN models on edge hasa wide range of practical and industrial applications acrossvarious sectors. Here are some specific examples:\u2022 Surveillance and Security : It can perform real-time ob-ject detection and facial recognition for security monitor-ing, identifying intruders, and managing access control.Face identification was deployed using VGGFace [7].Video analysis was deployed using YOLOX [8]. Infraredand Visible Image Fusion for security systems was de-ployed using DenseNet [9]. Human action recognitionapplications were deployed using ResNet [10].\u2022 Manufacturing and Quality Control : It can inspectproducts on assembly lines for defects, ensuring qualitycontrol and minimizing errors. Real-time detection ofsteel strip surface defects was deployed using Faster R-CNN model [11].\u2022 Agriculture: Drones can monitor crops, detect pests,diseases, and nutrient deficiencies, enabling precisionagriculture. Identifying rice leaf diseases in natural en-vironments was deployed using GoogLeNet [12]. Pepperleaf disease identification was deployed using GoogLeNet[13]. Detection for insect pests was deployed on YOLOX[14].\u2022 Healthcare and Wearables : Wearable devices can con-tinuously monitor vital signs, detect anomalies, and evendiagnose certain health conditions. Medical diagnosis(Covid and Lung Disease Detection) was deployed usingVGG, MobileNet, and AlexNet [15]. Automatically diag-nose pneumonia and COVID-19 from chest X-ray imageswas deployed on DenseNet [16]. Medical applications(e.g., COVID-19 detection, cardiomegaly diagnosis, braintumor classification) were deployed using ResNet [10].\u2022 Energy Management: It can monitor energy usage, opti-mize consumption patterns, and identify areas for energyefficiency improvements. Wind Turbine Maintenance andfault diagnosis was deployed using AlexNet [17].\u2022 Environmental Monitoring : It can monitor air quality,pollution levels, and weather conditions, providing valu-able insights for urban planning. A smartphone app toperform fine-grained classification of animals in the wildwas deployed using AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet[18]. Identification of mosquito species was deployedusing AlexNet, DenseNet, Inception, ResNet, and VGG[19].--- Page 3 ---3Fig. 2. Evolution of Key CNN Architectures Over Time.\u2022 Logistics and Inventory Management : It can automatepackage sorting, inventory tracking, and warehouse man-agement. Mobile robot to map its surroundings while de-tecting objects and people was deployed using AlexNet,GoogLeNet, and ResNet [18].\u2022 Autonomous Vehicles : Vehicles can process real-timedata from cameras and sensors using CNNs, aiding inautonomous navigation and collision avoidance. Instanceobjects detection system for intelligent service robots wasdeployed using Alexnet [20]. Advanced driving assistancesystems (ADASs) and automated vehicles (A Vs) weredeployed using Faster R-CNN [21].Deploying CNNs on edge devices presents significant chal-lenges mainly due to the limited computational resources,constrained memory, and power consumption constraints in-herent to these devices. CNN models, known for their depthand complexity, often demand substantial computational powerand memory, which may exceed the capabilities of edgehardware. Hence, compressing the model before deploymentbecomes imperative. Model compression techniques aim toreduce the size of the CNN model while preserving its perfor-mance, thereby enabling efficient utilization of computationalresources and memory on edge devices. By compressingthe model, we can mitigate the challenges associated withdeploying CNNs on edge devices, ensuring that they caneffectively perform tasks such as real-time image processing,object detection, and classification within resource-constrainedenvironments.With the enormous number of compression techniques pro-posed for CNNs, the rapid evolution of CNN architectures hascreated a gap in the field. This dynamic shift in architecturedesign requires an evaluation of existing compression methods,particularly in light of the demand to make these advancedCNN models suitable for deployment on edge devices. AsCNN designs continue to advance, the challenge lies inadapting compression techniques to smoothly integrate withthese modern architectures. This evaluation (either for eachindividual techniques or combined with each other) becomesimportant, as it not only ensures the continued relevance ofcompression techniques but also addresses the urgent need tomake resource-intensive CNN models accessible and deploy-able on edge devices.This work aims to evaluate CNN compression techniquesthat assure appropriate performance on edge devices. In thesubsequent sections, this work reveals in a structured mannerto evaluate the compression techniques for CNN models.section 2 provides a detailed review of related work, offeringinsights into prior research and establishing a foundationalunderstanding of the topic. section 3 explains the methodologyemployed in conducting the experiments, describing the designand execution of the study. Following this, section 4 presentsthe experimental results and analyzes the findings to recognizetrends and implications. Section 5 critically evaluates the re-sults. Section 6 draws conclusions regarding the effectivenessand significance of the compression techniques. This organizedframework aims to comprehensively explore and contribute tothe field of model compression for efficient deployment inresource-constrained environments.II. R ELATED WORKWithin the context of edge AI, it is important to address thecritical need for model compression. The resource constrainednature of these devices requires more efficient AI modelsby minimizing memory and computational demands, ensur-ing faster inference speeds, and enhancing energy efficiency.Below will explore various model compression techniques andtheir implications for edge AI applications.A. PruningPruning is a key technique in DNN, aimed at enhancingefficiency and model generalization. It involves the removalof redundant components, such as parameters, neurons, filters,or entire layers, leading to several advantages. By reducingunnecessary parameters, it cuts down on storage require-ments, and important for models deployed on devices withlimited memory. Furthermore, it streamlines computational--- Page 4 ---4Fig. 3. Weight Pruning (a) and Neuron Pruning (b). x: input, w: weight. [22].complexity during inference, resulting in faster predictions andlower power consumption. Pruning also mitigates overfittingby simplifying the network. Various pruning techniques, likeweight pruning, neuron pruning, filter pruning, and layerpruning, offer different levels of granularity in componentremoval. Whether applied during or after training, pruningenables the creation of more compact and efficient CNNmodels tailored to specific needs, effectively balancing modelsize, computational efficiency, and accuracy. Weight pruningsets weight connections in the network to zero if they fallbelow a predefined threshold or are considered redundant.Neuron pruning focuses on removing entire neurons if they arefound to be redundant. Layer pruning allows for the removalof entire layers that are considered less important [22].1) Pruning For Fully Connected Layer: Fully connectedlayers are dense that makes the layer with high memorydemand. Pruning them effectively reduces the memory burdenand reduce size of the model.It involves selectively removing weight connections andneurons to reduce the model\u2019s complexity while preservingperformance. In a typical feed-forward NN, inputs are multi-plied by corresponding weights, and a linear sum is computedat each neuron, which is then transformed by an activationfunction. As shown in Figure 3, a network with 3 inputneurons, 2 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron may havemultiple weight connections. Pruning can be applied to elim-inate specific weight connections or entire neurons. By doingso, the total number of weight connections can be significantlyreduced, leading to a more compact network. The concept ofpruning was first introduced by [6], who proposed removingweights based on their saliency, with small-magnitude weightshaving less impact on training error. The process involvesiterative retraining to regain accuracy, and the technique isknown as \u2019Optimal Brain Damage (OBD)\u2019 where the secondderivative of the objective function with respect to parametersis used to calculate the small saliency, facilitating informedpruning decisions. Since then, other pruning approaches havebeen introduced for fully connected layers [22].2) Pruning For Convolutional Layer: Each convolutionallayer typically consists of numerous filters that makes the layerwith high computational demand. Pruning these less significantfilters directly from the convolutional layer effectively reducesthe computational burden and speeds up the model. Inspired byearly pruning methods, new approaches have been introducedto be used to prune convolutional layers [22].Bayesian was used to decide what to prune and the level ofpruning, in this context involves employing scale mixtures ofnormals as priors for parameter weights in LeNet and VGG[23]. Differential evolution based layer-wise weight methodalongside three other pruning techniques (Naive Cut, Itera-tive Pruning, and Multi-Objective NN Pruning) was used toprune LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 [24]. Two fully connectedlayers are removed from the AlexNet architecture, and BatchNormalization (BN) is introduced to mitigate overfitting [20].Filters Similarity in Consecutive Layers (FSCL) for CNNs wasused to reduce the number of filters while preserving impor-tant filters, ultimately improving model efficiency for VGG,GoogLeNet, and ResNet [25]. Structured pruning throughsparsity-induced pruning was used to enhance the real-timeimplementation of the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) [26].Structured pruning was used to compress YOLOX, this processincluded sparse training to prune unimportant channels, withfine-tuning to recover accuracy [14]. Evolutionary approachto filter pruning involved sequential application of multiplepruners in a specific order to sparsify LeNet and VGG-19while maintaining model accuracy [27]. Multilayer networkswere used to represent and compress ResNets, it involvedcreating class networks, calculating arc weights, and forminga multilayer network. The overall degree of nodes in themultilayer network is used to select a subset of nodes forcompression, and convolutional layers are pruned [10]. Tooptimize the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny model for efficient detec-tion of COVID-19 and pneumonia in chest X-ray images,three steps were implemented including removing insignif-icant weights, discarding pruning casings, and applying acompression algorithm [16]. Deep Scalable Zerotree-based(DeepSZ) framework was used to address resource constraints--- Page 5 ---5by achieving significant compression for LeNet, AlexNet,and VGG while maintaining acceptable inference accuracy[28]. Compressing without retraining that was used withResNet, AlexNet, VGGNet and SqueezeNet. It focused onconvolutional and fully connected layers, while maintainingor improving classification accuracy [29].B. QuantizationQuantization plays an important role in addressing theresource-intensive nature of CNNs. By reducing the bit pre-cision of model parameters, quantization not only conservesmemory and energy but also enhances inference speed, makingit an essential technique for deploying CNNs in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. Weight clus-tering takes quantization to a more advanced level by orga-nizing weights into clusters, where each cluster shares thesame weight value. This approach minimizes the need forfine-tuning individual weights and can lead to substantialreductions in memory and computational overhead [22].Single Level Quantization (SLQ) and Multiple Level Quan-tization (MLQ) technique were used to quantize AlexNet,VGG, GoogleNet, and ResNet to the deployment of thesemodels on resource-constrained mobile devices like mobilephones and drones [30].C. Low-Rank Decomposition/FactorizationIt is a compression technique used with feed-forward NNsand CNNs, to reduce the size of weight matrices whilepreserving model performance. Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is a popular factorization scheme that decomposes aweight matrix A into three smaller matrices: U, S, and V T . Urepresents the left singular vectors, S is a diagonal matrix ofsingular values, and V T is the transpose of the right singularvectors. This factorization offers several advantages, such asreduced storage requirements, which is crucial for memory-constrained environments, and accelerated inference, espe-cially in CNNs, as smaller matrices can be convolved faster.Low-rank factorization can be applied to fully connected andconvolutional layers, making models more storage-efficientand faster without sacrificing performance. Careful selectionof the rank is essential for achieving a balance between sizereduction and model accuracy. Later, more approaches havebeen introduced [22].Tucker decomposition for weight tensors was used tooptimizes weight tensor dimensions of LeNet and ResNetmodels [31]. Low-rank decomposition was used as an efficientmethod for compressing AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet withoutthe need for fine-tuning to significantly reduce model sizeand computational complexity to make them more suitablefor resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices [32].Hardware-Aware Automatic Low-Rank Compression frame-work HALOC was used to compress ResNet, VGG andMobileNet, with the goal of efficiently exploring the structure-level redundancy in NNs by integrating principles from neuralarchitecture search (NAS) [33]. Automatically DifferentiableTensor Network (ADTN) method was used to significantlyreduce the number of parameters of fully connected NN,LeNet, and VGG while maintaining or enhancing the per-formance [34]. Joint Matrix Decomposition, specifically JointSVD (JSVD) was used to address the challenge of deployingResNet with numerous parameters on resource-constrainedplatforms. It included Right JSVD, Left JSVD, and BinaryJSVD algorithms [35]. Tensor Ring Networks (TR-Nets) wasused as a method to effectively factorize LeNet and ResNet,thereby reducing computational and memory requirements[36]. Tucker decomposition with rank selection and fine tuningwas used as a one-shot whole network compression schemefor deploying AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet on mobiledevices while maintaining reasonable accuracy [37]. TensorDynamic Low-Rank Training (TDLRT) was used to createa training algorithm with VGG and AlexNet that maintainshigh model performance while significantly reducing memoryrequirements for convolutional layers [38].D. Knowledge Distillation (KD)It is a technique used to transfer the knowledge learnedby a larger, more complex model (the teacher model) to asmaller and lighter model (the student model). The primarygoal of KD is to enable the student model to benefit from thegeneralization capabilities of the teacher model while beingmore lightweight in terms of parameters and computations.This technique helps to recover the accuracy drop occurs dueto implementing other compression techniques.Knowledge transfer and distillation, initially introduced by[39], aimed to compress large ensemble models into smaller,faster counterparts with minimal performance loss. [40] ex-tended this concept by empirically demonstrating that theintricate knowledge within larger DNNs could be effectivelytransferred to smaller, shallower models, yielding comparableaccuracy. This involved training a large DNN and transfer-ring its knowledge to a shallower network while minimizingthe squared difference between the logits produced by thetwo models. These foundational ideas produced knowledgedistillation, a widely used technique for training efficientmodels by transferring knowledge from larger ones. Later,more approaches have been introduced [22].KD was used to improve the compression of LeNet andResNet models when fresh training data is scarce, primarilythrough the use of synthetic data generated by GenerativeAdversarial Networks (GANs) [41]. To fuse information frominfrared and visible images while reducing DenseNet complex-ity and improving inference speed. Insights from pre-trainedteacher models are transferred to the smaller student model[9]. KD was used to develop a lightweight mosquito speciesidentification model (EfficientNet) that balances efficiency andaccuracy through the compression [42].E. Mixed TechniquesDifferent compression techniques are often combined andused together to achieve more effective and comprehensivemodel compression. Each compression technique targets spe-cific aspects of the model, such as reducing model size,computation complexity, or memory footprint.--- Page 6 ---6In-Parallel Pruning-Quantization CLIP-Q method combinesnetwork pruning and weight quantization was used to com-press AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet [18]. Pruning andquantization were used to optimize the compression ofAlexNet and reduce the number of parameters significantlywhile maintaining accuracy to be implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) [5]. Pruning, quantization,and Huffman encoding combined with adversarial trainingwere used to enhance the robustness and compression ofAlexNet while also addressing the model vulnerability toadversarial attacks [43]. Pruning and quantization were usedto compress VGG and ResNet for remote sensing imageclassification, balancing computational complexity constraintswhile preserving model accuracy [44]. Low-rank decompo-sition and quantization were used to compress ResNet andMobileNet, and reduce the computational complexity whilepreserving high performance [45]. Pruning, quantization, andchanging the model architecture were used to design a com-pact SqueezeNet with competitive accuracy while significantlyreducing the number of parameters [46]. Quantization andpruning were used to develop an effective model compressionframework for ResNet and MobileNet. The objective was tooptimize the allocation of compression ratios to minimizeperformance degradation while reducing model size [47]. Jointquantization and pruning were used to develop a post-trainingmodel size compression method that efficiently combines lossyand lossless compression techniques to reduce the size ofResNet, MobileNet, RegNet, MNasNet, and YOLOv5 withoutsacrificing accuracy [48].F . Other TechniquesDepthwise separable convolutions was used to improvesteel strip defect detection by creating a real-time and ef-ficient model while maintaining high accuracy using FasterR-CNN [11]. Deferential Evolution was used to develop anefficient and optimized AlexNet, VGG, and MobileNet forCovid and liver disease detection [15]. Genetic Algorithmwas used to reduce the storage space and inference timeof VGG, ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet models [49].Factorization (changing kernel size) was used to improvethe accuracy and computing efficiency of pepper leaf diseasedetection using GoogLeNet, specifically for the agriculturalindustry [13]. Flexible and Separable Convolution (FSConv)was used to reduce computational costs without compromisingthe accuracy of VGG, ResNet, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet[50]. Efficient Layer Compression (ELC) was used to enhancethe computational efficiency of VGG, ResNet, and ConvNeXtwhile preserving their representation capabilities [51].III. D ESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENTSThe experiments aimed to evaluate various compressiontechniques, namely pruning and quantization, on differenttypes of ConvNext [52] model. The experiments includedtraining, fine-tuning, and evaluating of models using CIFAR-10 dataset. The setup involved conducting experiments bothon cloud-based platforms and on edge devices to evaluate theperformance of the compressed models.Fig. 4. Block modifications and resulted specifications.

ConvNeXt [52]Is a modern CNN family produced as a journey of graduallymodernize a standard ResNet toward the design of a visionTransformer. The journey starts from a ResNet-50 model, intoa CNN architecture that mirrors some aspects of Transformers,particularly Swin Transformers. The roadmap:1) Training Techniques: Vision Transformer training pro-cedures were used to train ResNet-50 model, this includedextending the training to 300 epochs (90 epochs originally),using AdamW optimizer, and data augmentation techniques(Mixup, Cutmix, RandAugment, Random Erasing, and regu-larization schemes including Stochastic Depth).2) Macro Design: Number of blocks in each stage wasadjusted from (3, 4, 6, 3) to (3, 3, 9, 3) and the stem wasreplaced with a patchify layer implemented using a 4x4, stride4 convolutional layer (non-overlapping convolution).3) ResNeXt-ify: ResNeXt approach was adopted which isutilize grouped convolutions, where convolutional filters aredivided into groups, each handling a subset of input channels,a variation of grouped convolution known as depthwise convo-lution was adopted, and the network\u2019s width was expanded byincreasing the number of channels in the convolutional layers.4) Inverted Bottleneck: The hidden dimension of the MLPblock was changed to be four times wider than the inputdimension as shown in Figure 4 (a and b)5) Large Kernel Sizes: The position of the convolutionallayer is moved up and the kernel size was changed from (3x3)to (7x7) as shown in Figure 4 (a and c).B. Micro DesignReplacing ReLU with Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU),fewer normalization layers, Substituting Batch Normalization(BN) with Layer Normalization (LN), and introducing separatedownsampling layers as shown in Figure 5.C. Compression Techniques1) Pruning: Different pruning techniques have been usedincluding structured and unstructured techniques.\u2022 Only Train Once (OTO) [53]: OTO version 3 (OTOV3)is automated framework for structured pruning which in-volves removing entire structures or groups of parametersfrom a DNN. OTOv3 begins by analyzing the depen-dencies between the vertices of the target DNN. Thisanalysis involves identifying accessory, Shape-Dependent--- Page 7 ---7Fig. 5. Block designs for a ResNet, a Swin Transformer, and a ConvNeXt.Swin Transformer\u2019s block is more sophisticated due to the presence of multiplespecialized modules and two residual connections [52].(SD) joint, and unknown vertices that are adjacent andestablishing their interdependencies. The goal is to formnode groups based on these dependencies, laying thefoundation for identifying interdependent vertices duringstructured pruning.Using the information gathered from the dependencyanalysis, OTOv3 constructs a pruning dependency graph.This graph represents the interdependencies between ver-tices, with vertices in the same node group indicatingtheir interdependency during structured pruning. Thepruning dependency graph ensures the validity of theproduced subnetwork by preserving essential connectionsbetween vertices.OTOv3 partitions the trainable variables of the DNNinto Pruning Zero-Invariant Groups (PZIGs) based on thepruning dependency graph. PZIGs consist of pairwisetrainable variables grouped together, with each grouprepresenting a potential pruning structure. Node groupsadjacent to the DNN output and containing unknownvertices are excluded from forming PZIGs to preserveoutput shapes and ensure model robustness as shown inFigure 6.To jointly search for redundant pruning structures andtrain the remaining groups for optimal performance,OTOv3 employs the Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient(DHSPG) algorithm. DHSPG minimizes the objectivefunction while introducing a sparsity constraint to identifyredundant groups for removal. It employs saliency-drivenredundant identification and a hybrid training paradigmto control sparsity and achieve better generalization per-formance as shown in Figure 7.\u2022 L1 Unstructured [54] L1 unstructured pruning is atechnique used in machine learning, to reduce the sizeof neural networks by eliminating less important con-nections. Each weight in the network is assigned a scorebased on its magnitude. This score reflects the importanceof the weight in the network\u2019s performance. In l1 pruning,this score is often the absolute value of the weight.A threshold is set, typically by selecting the top x% ofweights based on their magnitude scores. The thresholddetermines which weights will be pruned and which willbe retained.Weights that fall below the threshold are pruned, meaningthey are set to zero and effectively removed from thenetwork. This results in a sparser network architecturewith fewer connections.\u2022 Random Unstructured [55] Similar to l1 unstructuredpruning, random unstructured pruning is also a techniqueused in machine learning, to reduce the size of neuralnetworks by eliminating less important connections. Thedifference is the pruned weight are selected randomlyinstead of using l1 to decide the importance of theweights.2) Dynamic Quantization [30]:Dynamic quantization is anapproach aimed at optimizing the deployment of neural net-works by reducing the precision of the weights. Unlike tradi-tional quantization methods that apply a fixed quantization bit-width across all layers of the network, dynamic quantizationadapts the quantization bit-width for each layer individuallybased on its representation abilities and capacities. This isachieved through the use of a bit-width controller module,which employs a policy gradient-based training approach tolearn the optimal bit-width for each layer. By dynamicallyadjusting the quantization bit-width, dynamic quantization canstrike a balance between maintaining accuracy and reducingmemory size and computational costs.D. CIFAR-10 [56]CIFAR-10 is a dataset used for computer vision and ma-chine learning research, offering a rich resource for trainingand evaluating image classification algorithms. Comprising60,000 32x32 RGB color images across 10 distinct classes(Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse,Ship, and Truck), CIFAR-10 facilitates comprehensive explo-ration of diverse visual concepts. With each class containing6,000 images and a balanced distribution across the dataset,CIFAR-10 presents a well-structured foundation for model de-velopment. Its division into 50,000 training images and 10,000test images, further segmented into multiple batches, enablesstrict evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms. In terms ofcomputational requirements, CIFAR-10 generally requires lesscomputation compared to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet due to itssmaller image size and fewer classes which makes it suitablefor experiments with limited computational resources.E. Experiment SetupTwo types of experiments have been conducted, cloud-basedexperiments that focused on compressing the models and eval-uating the techniques and edge-based experiment experimentto evaluate the performance of one of the compressed models.--- Page 8 ---8Fig. 6. Automated PZIG Partition [53].Fig. 7. Search Direction in DHSPG [53].1) Cloud-based Experiment Setup: Google Colab Pro+was used to utilize GPU resources (NVIDIA A100 and V100Tensor Core GPUs), facilitating accelerated model trainingand evaluation and background execution. The integrationwith Google Drive reduced overheads associated with upload-ing and downloading model data to and from cloud. Theevaluation framework was designed to profile the originalmodel, compress it, profile the compressed model, and conductcomparison between the measurements before and after thecompression as shown in Figure 8.This profiling process involved measuring several key met-rics:\u2022 Accuracy: The classification accuracy achieved by themodel on the validation dataset.\u2022 Model Size: The size of the model in megabytes (MB).\u2022 Number of Parameters : The total count of trainableparameters in the model, measured in millions (M).\u2022 Number of MACs : The number of multiply-accumulateoperations performed during inference, measured in mil-lions (M).\u2022 Number of Non-Zero Parameters : The count of non-zero parameters in the model, essential for pruning-basedtechniques.2) Edge-based Experiment Setup: A compressed modelwas deployed on edge with CPU (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz 2.80 GHz), RAM (16GB), and laptopintegrated camera.2 samples from each of CIFAR-10 classes have been se-lected randomly from the internet, printed on A4 papers, andplaced in front of the camera to measure the accuracy and theinference time.--- Page 9 ---9Fig. 8.

R UNNING THE EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIMENTALRESULTSA. Cloud-Base Experimentsdifferent experiments have been conducted on cloud to eval-uate different compressing techniques and different versions ofConvNeXt model.1) Evaluate OTOV3 on Untrained Torch ConvNext Tiny,Small, Base, and Large: Untrained ConvNeXt tiny, small,base, and large have been imported from Torch and beenused to evaluate OTOV3 which train and prune at the sametime, CIFAR-10 was used for training and evaluation, and 200epochs were used for training and pruning. OTOV3 achievedhigh performance (Table I) with reducing the model size(61% for tiny and 75% for small, base, and large), numberof parameters (61% for tiny and 75% for small, base, andlarge), and MACs (45% for tiny and 60% for small, base,and large) as shown in Figure 9. Meanwhile OTOV3 wasable to increase both the full and compressed model accuracythrough the training and pruning without any accuracy dropafter pruning comparing to the full model.To investigate the effect of OTOV3 on the model archi-tecture, a comparison has been conducted between ConvNeXtsmall before and after compression. The Torch implementationof the model consist of many CNBlocks, each CNBlock con-sist of Conv2d, Permute, LayerNorm, Linear, GELU, Linear,and Permute layers. As shown in Figure 10, OTOV3 reducednumber of output features of the Linear layer (sequence 3)and the input features of the next Linear layer (sequence 5)and considering the big number of CNBlock in the modelarchitecture, the reduction in model size and number ofparameters after compression is justified as shown in TableII.2) Evaluate OTOV3 on Untrained ConvNext Small (Torchvs. TIMM): Two untrained ConvNeXt small have been im-ported, one from Torch and one from TIMM [57] and beenused to evaluate OTOV3 which train and prune at the sametime, CIFAR-10 was used for training and evaluation, and200 epochs were used for training and pruning. Although thecompression performance was same with size reduction (75%)but the accuracy after 200 epochs was less for Torch model(63%) comparing to TIMM model (73%) as shown in Figure11.To investigate the accuracy performance of OTOV3 withTorch and Timm ConvNeXt Small, a comparison has beenconducted between the two model architectures. The Torchmodel uses the CNBlock structure, which includes additionaloperations such as Permute and varying StochasticDepth prob-abilities. The TIMM model follows a simpler structure withConv2d and LayerNorm, lacking the additional complexitiesintroduced by CNBlock and associated operations in theTorch model as shown in Figure 12 which effects OTOV3performance regarding the accuracy.3) Evaluate OTOV3 on Fine-Tuned Torch ConvNext Small:A pre-trained ConvNeXt small have been imported from Torchand fine-tuned on CIFAR-10 with 100 epochs, the accuracyreached 89.5%. This fine-tuned ConvNeXt small will be usedfor the rest of cloud-base experiments. This model was usedto evaluate OTOV3, CIFAR-10 was used for training andevaluation, and 200 epochs were used for training and pruning.OTOV3 achieved high performance (Table III) 74% reductionin model size and number of parameters, 60% reduction inMACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy as shown Figure13. The accuracy of the full model in (Table III) (92.86%)is different that the accuracy of the original model used inthe experiment (89.5%), that because OTOV3 trained the full--- Page 10 ---10Fig. 9.

OTOV3 Comparison Between Torch and Timm ConvNeXt Small.model during the process which increased the model accuracy.4) Evaluate Unstructured Pruning: The Fine-tuned Con-vNext Small was used to evaluate Pytorch L1 UnstructuredPruning and Random Unstructured Pruning by using differentcombinations of weights pruning percentages for linear (.1 to.9) and convolutional (.1 to .9) layers. In both experiments,the accuracy and the number of non-zero parameters weredropping as the values of weights pruning percentages for bothlinear and convolutional amounts were increasing as shown inFigure 14 a and b. Although the accuracy dropped but themodel size, number of parameters, and MACs didn\u2019t changeas these techniques zero the weights instead of removing them.5) Evaluate Dynamic Quantization: The Fine-tuned Con-vNext Small was used to evaluate Pytorch dynamic quantiza-tion, 8-bit integer was used during the experiment and CIFAR-10 was used for evaluation. Dynamic quantization achievedhigh performance (Table IV) 71% reduction in model size,95% reduction with number of parameters and MACs, and0.1% drop with accuracy as shown in Figure 156) Evaluate Combination of OTOV3 and Dynamic Quan-tization: Two compression stages were evaluated together asone compression pipeline, OTOV3 and Dynamic Quantization.The compressed ConvNeXt small model that was produced inexperiment 4.1.3 (OTOV3) was furtherly compressed using--- Page 11 ---11Fig. 12. Comparison Between ConvNeXt Small TIMM (Left) and Torch (Right).Fig. 13. OTOV3 Compression Performance with ConvNeXt Small Tuned.Pytorch dynamic quantization using 8-bits integer (similar toexperiment 4.1.5). The pruned models using OTOV2 [58]had dependencies on Open Nural Network Exchange (ONNX)[59] which made it not applicable to be combined with othercompression technique like quantization. In OTOv3, there wasengineering changes produced the pruned model directly inPytorch format, which enhanced the flexibility to be combinedwith quantization as this experiment did [53].Pruning using OTOV3 and Quantization using Pytorchdynamic quantization achieved high performance (Table V)89.7% reduction in model size, 95% reduction with numberof parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy asshown in 16.B. Edge-Base ExperimentThe final compressed ConvNeXt Small model in experimentIV .A.6 (OTV3 and Dynamic Quantization) was deployed onedge and the printed samples used to measure the accuracyand inference time by placing them in front of the camera.The compressed model achieved 92.5% accuracy and 20msinference time. Figure 17 shows samples of the output.V. A NALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSHere, the experimental results obtained from running aseries of experiments will be analyzed, the experiments aimedat evaluating various compression techniques applied to Con-vNeXt models. The experiments were designed to evaluate theperformance of techniques such as pruning and quantizationon different sizes of ConvNeXt models, with a focus on bothcloud-based compression experiments and edge-based deploy-ment experiment. The analysis will be conducted with respectto the work\u2019s aim of evaluating CNN compression techniquesthat assure appropriate performance (size and inference time)on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.A. OTOV3 Evaluation on Untrained ConvNeXt ModelsThe evaluation of OTOV3 on untrained ConvNeXt modelsdemonstrated its effectiveness in achieving substantial com-pression while increasing model accuracy for both full andcompressed models. Across varying sizes of ConvNeXt mod-els, OTOV3 consistently produced impressive reductions inmodel size, number of parameters, and MACs, highlighting itsability to prune redundant structures effectively. This suggests--- Page 12 ---12Fig. 14.

Samples From the Compressed Model Output on Edge.that OTOV3 efficiently identifies and removes unnecessaryparameters from the models, leading to more streamlinedarchitectures without compromising predictive performance.However, an unexpected observation arose when comparingthe accuracy of the Torch implementation with that of theTIMM implementation of ConvNeXt Small. The Torch im-plementation exhibited lower accuracy compared to its TIMMcounterpart, indicating that OTOV3\u2019s performance regardingaccuracy may be influenced by the details of the modelarchitecture. This unexpected result suggests that differenttraining strategies or adjustments may be necessary to optimizeOTOV3\u2019s performance across various model implementations,emphasizing the importance of considering architectural dif-ferences when applying compression techniques like OTOV3.B. OTOV3 Evaluation on Fine-Tuned ConvNeXt ModelsWhen evaluating OTOV3\u2019s performance on a fine-tunedConvNeXt model, notable improvements in compression per-formance were observed, confirming its effectiveness in re-ducing model size, parameters, and MACs while marginallyenhancing accuracy. This outcome highlights the potential ofintegrating fine-tuning with structured pruning techniques toachieve even greater optimization of model performance. Thefine-tuned model displayed enhanced compression capabilitiescompared to untrained models, suggesting that pre-trainingcan significantly increase the effectiveness of compressiontechniques. This finding highlights the importance of lever-aging pre-existing knowledge within models to maximize thebenefits of compression, ultimately resulting in CNN modelswith higher performance.C. Unstructured Pruning TechniquesDuring the evaluation of l1 unstructured and random un-structured pruning techniques, expected trends were observedregarding accuracy and compression. As the pruning per-centages increased for both linear and convolutional layers,a corresponding decrease in accuracy was noted, while themodel size, parameters, and MACs remained unaltered. Thisoutcome aligns with the inherent nature of unstructured prun-ing, wherein weights are zeroed out but not entirely eliminated,resulting in sparse models without substantial reductions incomputational complexity. However, the lack of significantreductions in computational complexity may constrain their ef-fectiveness, particularly in resource-constrained environmentswhere efficient utilization of computational resources is essen-tial. This highlights the importance of considering the trade-offs between model compression and computational efficiencywhen selecting pruning techniques for deployment in real---- Page 14 ---14TABLE VIOTOV3 AND DYNAMIC QUANTIZATION REDUCTION NUMBERS WITH CONV NEXT SMALL TUNED .Technique AccuracyChange Size Reduction ParametersReductionMACsReductionOTOV3 3.75% 73.51% 73.62% 60.18%Dynamic Quantization -0.15% 71.30% 95.43% 95.71%OTOV3 and DynamicQuantization 3.80% 89.74% 95.43% 95.71%world applications, especially in edge computing scenarioswhere computational resources are limited.D.
