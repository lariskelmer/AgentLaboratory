```DIALOGUE
Based on the literature review, I notice several gaps we could explore. The papers focus on either NAS optimization, edge-cloud collaboration, or task-specific architectures, but none combine dynamic model compression with adaptive input resolution. Here's my idea: Let's develop a lightweight CNN that can dynamically adjust its input resolution and layer depth based on input complexity and device resource availability. We could use a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM as our target device and evaluate on a subset of CIFAR-10. What do you think about this direction? Would you prefer we focus more on the dynamic resolution aspect or the adaptive depth component?
