  plan-formulation:
    # General objective
    - "You must propose an original research idea focused on optimizing models for image classification on edge devices (Edge AI)."
    - "Your focus will be to design **ONE** specific and feasible experiment, detailing: the proposed technique, a baseline for comparison, evaluation metrics, and the experimental environment (device and dataset)."

    # Research focus and scope definition
    - "Begin by clearly defining the research scope within Edge AI: identify subtopics such as popular models, edge-specific optimization techniques, quantization, structured pruning, tailored distillation, federated learning, privacy, latency, and energy consumption."
    - "The optimization technique you propose must be **genuinely innovative**, not a trivial adaptation of existing methods. Clearly state the originality and potential contributions of your approach."
    - "Specify the base model (e.g., MobileNetV2 without optimization), the target edge device (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 with X GB RAM), and the dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or an adapted ImageNet subset)."
    - "List the metrics to be measured: accuracy, latency, model size, energy consumption. Describe your methodology for measuring each."
    - "Ensure the experiment is **reproducible, modular, and feasible** with typical academic resources."

    # Literature search and selection strategy
    - "Formulate a search query using precise keywords and/or Boolean logic to collect recent peer-reviewed articles on optimization techniques for Edge AI. Use this literature to ground and inspire your original research proposal. Justify your query choices."
    - "Justify your keyword selection and explain how your query captures the relevant subtopics and technical directions."
    - "Describe a **systematic methodology** to search for and sample a representative subset of peer-reviewed scientific articles, preferably open-access and published within the last 5 years."
    - "This methodology should aim to select articles with clear research aims, context, value, and findings."
    - "Prioritize articles with clear goals, verifiable technical contributions, and relevance to your proposed problem."

    # Output structure
    - "Propose a structured outline for organizing the final literature review document. Include typical sections such as: introduction, motivation, thematic areas, challenges, recent solutions, knowledge gaps, and future directions."

    # Experimental plan structure and coherence
    - "Ensure that the experimental plan is **logical, detailed, and cohesive**, suitable for publication or practical execution."
    - 'DO NOT PLAN TOO LONG. Submit your plan soon.'
    - "Use DeepSeek-Chat to perform this task."

  data-preparation:
  # - 'Instruções para a preparação dos dados, referências, datasets, etc.'
    - 'Use a public, well-documented dataset for image classification, suitable for experimentation on edge devices (e.g. CIFAR-10, or a reduced/adapted version of a larger dataset).'
    - "Describe all preprocessing and data augmentation steps necessary to improve training efficiency or inference quality on edge devices."
    - 'Here is a sample code you can use to load CIFAR-10\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ncifar10_test_set = load_dataset("cifar10")["test"]\n# Para carregar o conjunto de treino, você usaria:\n# cifar10_train_set = load_dataset("cifar10")["train"]'
  
  running-experiments:
  # - 'Instruções sobre como rodar experimentos, código, parâmetros, limitações, etc.'
    - "For all strings you instantiate you must use triple quotes (''')"
    - "Use the appropriate tools and libraries for edge deployment and inference (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile, ONNX Runtime)."
    - "Perform real inference on a simulated environment that approximates edge constraints."
    - "Measure and report key metrics, including: accuracy, latency (in milliseconds), model size (in MB), and power consumption (if measurable)."
    - "Ensure code is modular and well-documented. Include configuration parameters and execution instructions for reproducibility."
    - "Use parallel processing where appropriate to optimize batch inference or performance evaluations."
    - "Record observations related to system behavior, execution stability, and resource usage."
    - "If you encounter errors during execution, log them and attempt to correct them using reflection-based iteration."
    - 'Your plan should be reproducible and structured for future generalization'
    - 'Use the following code to inference deepseek-chat\nresponse = query_deepseekv3(prompt=prompt, system=system_prompt)'

  results-interpretation:
  # - 'Instruções sobre como interpretar os resultados, comparar, validar, etc.'
    - "Analyze the results obtained from the real execution of your technique, comparing them to the defined baseline (e.g., MobileNetV2 without optimization)."
    - "Use the collected metrics (accuracy, latency, model size, power usage) to assess the effectiveness of your method."
    - "Discuss observed trade-offs and evaluate whether your optimization improves edge applicability without sacrificing too much model performance."
    - 'Compare your results (qualitatively, if not directly) with those of related work identified in the literature review.'
    - 'Compare findings across multiple papers for consistency.'
    - "Evaluate limitations or edge-case failures encountered during execution and how they may impact the feasibility of the proposed solution."
    - 'Consider limitations or biases in the retrieved data and their possible impact on conclusions.'
    - "Summarize key insights from the experiment, highlighting both practical gains and research-relevant discoveries or questions."

  report-writing:
