('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show that their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR and 0.71 SSIM for denoising while maintaining 76% classification accuracy on ImageNet-100 at 13.7ms latency. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior performance compared to sequential approaches, particularly in preserving image quality for human verification while meeting real-time constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on edge devices. Key experimental results show that combining OTOv3 pruning with dynamic quantization achieves 89.7% model size reduction and 95% reduction in parameters/MACs while improving accuracy by 3.8% on CIFAR-10. The compressed model demonstrates practical edge deployment with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms inference time. The work provides valuable empirical comparisons of compression techniques, showing structured pruning preserves accuracy better than unstructured methods, and quantization achieves the most significant parameter reduction (95%) with minimal accuracy impact.\\narXiv ID: 2106.06560v1, Summary: This paper presents HR-NAS, a neural architecture search method that optimizes high-resolution representations for real-time image classification on edge devices. The authors introduce a lightweight transformer module that can be dynamically scaled to balance accuracy and computational cost. HR-NAS achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs, demonstrating 45.9% improved efficiency over specialized segmentation models while maintaining accuracy. The method effectively combines multi-scale convolutional features with global attention mechanisms, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering both algorithmic efficiency and hardware constraints. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that reduces computational redundancy while maintaining contiguous memory access patterns crucial for GPU efficiency. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes a novel latency prediction model that guides architecture design by considering hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithmic parameters simultaneously.\\narXiv ID: 2108.07879v1, Summary: This paper presents NeuRRAM, a resistive RAM (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM) chip that achieves unprecedented energy efficiency for edge AI image classification. The key innovation is a cross-layer co-design approach that optimizes across device, circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels. NeuRRAM demonstrates 5-8\xd7 better energy efficiency than prior art while maintaining software-comparable accuracy (85.7% on CIFAR-10) with 4-bit weights. The architecture features a novel transposable neurosynaptic array enabling bidirectional dataflow and a voltage-mode neuron circuit supporting configurable bit-precisions (1-6 bit inputs, 1-8 bit outputs). Hardware-algorithm co-optimization techniques including noise-resilient training and chip-in-the-loop fine-tuning mitigate analog non-idealities. The chip achieves 70% lower image reconstruction error than noisy inputs while consuming minimal energy.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) for ConvNeXt models on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings show OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while increasing accuracy by 3.8%. Dynamic quantization alone reduces parameters by 95% with minimal accuracy drop (0.1%). The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy. Edge deployment of the compressed model demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time, validating effectiveness for real-time edge applications.

The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to achieve 4-17x faster search times compared to prior hardware-aware NAS approaches. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. The approach demonstrates strong transferability across datasets while maintaining low search costs (0.06 GPU days on ImageNet). Key innovations include differentiable resource constraints and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving superior efficiency compared to sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously.

The method demonstrates effective trade-offs between computational efficiency and task performance, making it suitable for real-time edge applications like surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable neural architecture search method for designing efficient convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" formulation that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared convolutional parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. This approach reduces NAS search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 TPU-hours), achieving 5000x speedup compared to prior work. On ImageNet classification, the method achieves state-of-the-art 74.96% top-1 accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in both search efficiency and model performance for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper presents AutoShrink, a topology-aware neural architecture search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that starts with a complete directed acyclic graph (DAG) and iteratively removes redundant edges while accumulating topological knowledge. This method enables flexible exploration of network connectivity patterns within cell structures while intrinsically reducing the search space. For image classification on ImageNet-1K, AutoShrink achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MAC reduction compared to MobileNetV2 while maintaining comparable accuracy.

   - Primary: Energy-Accuracy Product (EAP = energy * (1-accuracy))
   - Secondary: 
     * Configuration prediction accuracy
     * 95th percentile latency
     * Memory footprint

5. Implementation Steps:
   a) Train base MobileNetV3 on CIFAR-100
