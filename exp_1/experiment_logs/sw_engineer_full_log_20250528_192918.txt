('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper proposes a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The key innovation is sharing an encoder between the denoiser and classifier to improve efficiency. The authors modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experiments show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where human verification of automated decisions is important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources. Their method outperforms previous approaches in RAC performance, achieving up to 51.4% reduction in encoding latency while improving classification accuracy by 0.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The system is particularly valuable for real-world edge applications where both computational constraints and classification performance are critical.\\narXiv ID: 2103.12529v1, Summary: This paper presents EG-DARTS, a multi-objective neural architecture search method that optimizes both classification accuracy and network complexity for edge devices. The approach combines gradient-based search at the block level with evolutionary optimization at the network level. Key innovations include an enhanced gradient method that considers both performance and complexity during architecture search, and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct efficient target networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters (0.64M vs 3.3M in DARTS) while maintaining accuracy. The paper provides valuable insights about the relationship between network depth and inference time, which is crucial for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 1905.04159v1, Summary: This paper introduces Single-Path NAS, a novel differentiable Neural Architecture Search method that optimizes convolutional networks for edge devices. The key innovation is a single-path, over-parameterized "superkernel" that encodes all architectural decisions (kernel size, expansion ratio) within shared parameters, eliminating the need for separate paths. The method achieves 74.96% top-1 ImageNet accuracy with 79ms latency on a Pixel 1 phone, while reducing search cost to just 8 epochs (3.75 hours) - up to 5,000x faster than prior NAS methods. The approach directly optimizes for on-device latency through a differentiable runtime model and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes architectures for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with similar accuracy, and 3x smaller than DARTS variants. Key results include 97.2% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters (1.37 GPU hours search time) and 24.4% top-1 error on ImageNet with 5.3M parameters. The approach demonstrates effective trade-offs between model size, accuracy and search efficiency for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key results show the NAS-designed models outperform manual designs, achieving 76.0% accuracy on ImageNet100 with 13.7ms latency while maintaining strong denoising performance (25.4 PSNR). The integrated architecture demonstrates better efficiency than sequential approaches, with 2.4ms faster inference and 0.6dB better PSNR compared to UNet-S baseline. The work provides valuable insights for deploying multi-task vision models on resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 1911.09251v1, Summary: This paper introduces AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method that discovers efficient neural architectures for edge devices. The key innovation is a progressive edge shrinking approach that reduces the search space while maintaining flexibility. AutoShrink represents architectures as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and iteratively removes less important edges. Experiments show ShrinkCNN achieves 48% parameter reduction and 34% MACs reduction on ImageNet-1K compared to MobileNetV2, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The method is also applied to RNNs (ShrinkRNN), demonstrating broad applicability. Notably, AutoShrink completes architecture searches in just 1.5 GPU hours, significantly faster than prior NAS methods. The work provides an efficient approach for discovering compact neural architectures optimized for resource-constrained edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show: 1) OTOV3 pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size/parameters while maintaining accuracy; 2) Dynamic quantization achieves 95% parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop; 3) Combined OTOV3+quantization achieves 89.7% size reduction and 95% parameter/MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency on edge hardware, demonstrating effective compression for real-time edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2304.04518v1, Summary: This paper systematically evaluates the impact of image compression on visual recognition tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) using both traditional and neural compression methods. Key findings show that while compression significantly impacts accuracy (e.g., segmentation mIoU drops from 44.5 to 30.5 at 0.1 bpp), most performance loss (82%) can be recovered by finetuning models on compressed images. The work demonstrates neural compression methods (GMM hyperprior) outperform traditional codecs, enabling 4-12x data reduction while maintaining accuracy when models are adapted to compression artifacts.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes for edge device constraints like model size and FLOPs while significantly reducing search time. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells that enable 4-17x faster search than prior hardware-aware NAS methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters). The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and maintains performance when scaled to tighter resource constraints.\\nPlan: Research Proposal: "Context-Aware Dynamic Neural Architecture Switching (CANDAS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\nCore Innovation: A novel system that dynamically switches between specialized sub-models based on real-time assessment of three key factors:\\n1) Image complexity (via edge density/entropy analysis)\\n2) Device state (battery level, thermal throttling status)\\n3) Temporal context (LSTM-predicted upcoming frames\\' complexity)\\n\\nTechnical Approach:\\n1.
