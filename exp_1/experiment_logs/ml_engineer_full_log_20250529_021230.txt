('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, achieving better efficiency than sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, with significant improvements in both denoising (PSNR/SSIM) and classification accuracy while meeting real-time latency constraints. The approach is particularly effective for applications like surveillance systems where human verification of automated classifications is needed.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet demonstrate the framework\\'s ability to find Pareto optimal solutions that balance model size, FLOPs, and accuracy. The approach is particularly relevant for real-time image classification on edge devices as it automatically adapts to varying hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. PIT jointly optimizes three key architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor through a novel differentiable masking approach. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (PPG-based heart rate monitoring, ECG arrhythmia detection, sEMG gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) show PIT can find models with 15.9-152x fewer parameters than seed networks while maintaining accuracy. When deployed on GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU, PIT-optimized models achieve up to 5.5x latency reduction and 3.8x energy savings compared to hand-tuned baselines. The method is particularly notable for its efficient search process (comparable to single training) and ability to explore a large search space (up to 10^12 architectures) while maintaining low GPU memory requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method introduces weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS with similar performance. The approach is particularly notable for its ability to automatically adapt to different hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for real-world edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency over sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better human perception of noisy images while maintaining real-time performance on edge hardware. The integrated architecture reduces computational overhead by 45% compared to separate denoising and classification models, making it particularly suitable for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both machine classification and human verification are important.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates various model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning, dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization provides 95% parameter reduction. The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 3.8% accuracy improvement. On-device deployment demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency, validating effectiveness for edge deployment. The work provides comprehensive empirical analysis of compression tradeoffs for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2101.09336v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a detailed taxonomy and analysis of hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) methods. It categorizes approaches based on search space design, search strategies, acceleration techniques, and hardware cost estimation methods. The paper is particularly relevant as it focuses on optimizing neural architectures for resource-constrained platforms like edge devices, discussing tradeoffs between accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics (latency, energy, memory). It also identifies key challenges in deploying NAS-generated models on edge devices and suggests future research directions.\\narXiv ID: 2503.02891v3, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a systematic analysis of model compression and acceleration techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. It covers three main optimization approaches: (1) Model compression techniques including pruning (structured/unstructured, static/dynamic), knowledge distillation (logit-based, feature-based, relation-based), and quantization (uniform/non-uniform, PTQ/QAT); (2) Hardware-aware acceleration strategies for GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs; (3) Software-hardware co-design approaches. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different methods\\' impact on accuracy, efficiency (GFLOPS reduction up to 61.4%), and hardware adaptability, along with practical deployment considerations for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2005.02177v1, Summary: This paper presents Classification Driven Compression (CDC), a framework for edge-cloud collaborative deep learning that optimizes the tradeoff between bandwidth consumption and classification accuracy. The key innovation is a lightweight autoencoder with classification guidance that selectively preserves features critical for accurate classification while compressing data. CDC achieves 14.9x bandwidth reduction with \u22641.06% accuracy drop compared to raw data training, and outperforms standard autoencoders by at least 100% in accuracy preservation. The method includes an adjustable quantization scheme for dynamic compression ratio adaptation based on network conditions, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective.

The approach is particularly effective for applications like surveillance systems where human verification of automated classifications is needed.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper introduces DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches) while discovering architectures that are 10-15x smaller than manual designs with comparable accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet demonstrate the framework\\'s ability to find Pareto optimal solutions that balance model size, FLOPs, and accuracy. The approach is particularly relevant for real-time image classification on edge devices as it automatically adapts to varying hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.\\narXiv ID: 2301.10281v1, Summary: This paper presents PIT (Pruning in Time), a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically designed for optimizing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) on edge devices. PIT jointly optimizes three key architectural parameters: number of channels, receptive field, and dilation factor through a novel differentiable masking approach. Experimental results on four edge-relevant tasks (PPG-based heart rate monitoring, ECG arrhythmia detection, sEMG gesture recognition, and keyword spotting) show PIT can find models with 15.9-152x fewer parameters than seed networks while maintaining accuracy. When deployed on GAP8 IoT processor and STM32H7 MCU, PIT-optimized models achieve up to 5.5x latency reduction and 3.8x energy savings compared to hand-tuned baselines. The method is particularly notable for its efficient search process (comparable to single training) and ability to explore a large search space (up to 10^12 architectures) while maintaining low GPU memory requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes deep learning models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The method introduces weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to significantly reduce search time (4-17x faster than prior hardware-aware NAS approaches). Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS can discover models 15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, and 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS with similar performance. The approach is particularly notable for its ability to automatically adapt to different hardware constraints without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for real-world edge deployment scenarios.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, significantly improving efficiency over sequential approaches. They modify a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance simultaneously. Experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving better human perception of noisy images while maintaining real-time performance on edge hardware. The integrated architecture reduces computational overhead by 45% compared to separate denoising and classification models, making it particularly suitable for applications like medical imaging and surveillance systems where both machine classification and human verification are important.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper evaluates various model compression techniques (structured/unstructured pruning, dynamic quantization) on ConvNeXt models for edge image classification. Key results show OTOV3 pruning achieves 75% model size reduction while maintaining accuracy, and dynamic quantization provides 95% parameter reduction. The combined approach yields 89.7% size reduction and 3.8% accuracy improvement. On-device deployment demonstrates 92.5% accuracy with 20ms latency, validating effectiveness for edge deployment. The work provides comprehensive empirical analysis of compression tradeoffs for resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2101.09336v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a detailed taxonomy and analysis of hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) methods. It categorizes approaches based on search space design, search strategies, acceleration techniques, and hardware cost estimation methods. The paper is particularly relevant as it focuses on optimizing neural architectures for resource-constrained platforms like edge devices, discussing tradeoffs between accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics (latency, energy, memory). It also identifies key challenges in deploying NAS-generated models on edge devices and suggests future research directions.\\narXiv ID: 2503.02891v3, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper provides a systematic analysis of model compression and acceleration techniques for Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. It covers three main optimization approaches: (1) Model compression techniques including pruning (structured/unstructured, static/dynamic), knowledge distillation (logit-based, feature-based, relation-based), and quantization (uniform/non-uniform, PTQ/QAT); (2) Hardware-aware acceleration strategies for GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs; (3) Software-hardware co-design approaches. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different methods\\' impact on accuracy, efficiency (GFLOPS reduction up to 61.4%), and hardware adaptability, along with practical deployment considerations for real-time edge applications.\\narXiv ID: 2005.02177v1, Summary: This paper presents Classification Driven Compression (CDC), a framework for edge-cloud collaborative deep learning that optimizes the tradeoff between bandwidth consumption and classification accuracy. The key innovation is a lightweight autoencoder with classification guidance that selectively preserves features critical for accurate classification while compressing data. CDC achieves 14.9x bandwidth reduction with \u22641.06% accuracy drop compared to raw data training, and outperforms standard autoencoders by at least 100% in accuracy preservation. The method includes an adjustable quantization scheme for dynamic compression ratio adaptation based on network conditions, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge deployments.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective.

Key innovations include a differentiable resource constraint formulation and a lookup graph for efficient constraint mapping. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-latency tradeoffs, with models that maintain performance while being 32% smaller than ProxylessNAS and having lower inference latency than PC-DARTS on edge devices.\\nPlan: Research Plan: "Differentiable Joint Architecture-Compression Search (DJACS) for Edge Image Classification"\\n\\n1.
