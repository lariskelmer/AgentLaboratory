('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach to jointly optimize image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show their NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 25.6 PSNR for denoising and 76.0% accuracy for classification on ImageNet-100 with a latency of 13.7ms. The integrated architecture demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential approaches while maintaining competitive classification performance, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring human verification like medical imaging and surveillance systems.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. The key innovation is a differentiable constrained optimization formulation that uses weight sharing and channel bottlenecks to reduce search time. Experimental results show DCA-NAS discovers models that outperform manual architectures (15x smaller with <1% accuracy drop on CIFAR-10) and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art NAS methods while being 4-17x faster in search time. On ImageNet-1k, it produces models with 24.4% top-1 error at 5.3M parameters, demonstrating effective trade-offs between accuracy and resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network that optimizes image classification for edge devices by considering practical inference latency rather than just theoretical FLOPs. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatial adaptation approach that processes image patches (rather than individual pixels) guided by a novel latency prediction model that accounts for hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. Experiments show LASNet reduces ResNet-101 latency by 36% on Tesla V100 and 46% on Jetson TX2 GPUs while maintaining accuracy. The method outperforms pixel-level dynamic networks by optimizing memory access patterns and includes operator fusion techniques to further reduce overhead. The latency predictor enables efficient architecture search across different hardware platforms without requiring extensive on-device testing.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) on edge devices, combining edge detection with adaptive temporal sampling to optimize power efficiency. The method first applies Canny edge detection to extract key image features, then converts these edges into temporal signals using an image-to-signal conversion algorithm. An adaptive sampling mechanism dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on signal variation, feeding into threshold-based or step-forward encoding schemes. Experimental results on MNIST show 18x and 7x reductions in reconstruction error compared to conventional methods while maintaining classification capability. The approach significantly reduces spike counts (41.7% reduction in signal length) compared to raw image encoding, making it particularly suitable for low-power edge deployment. The paper includes comprehensive analysis of sampling thresholds and introduces a fitness function to balance reconstruction accuracy against computational efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2005.10851v1, Summary: This paper introduces a conditionally deep hybrid neural network for edge-cloud collaborative inference, combining quantized layers at the edge with full-precision layers in the cloud. The key innovation is an early-exit mechanism that allows easy samples to be classified at the edge (using binary/4-bit quantized networks) while only routing difficult samples to the cloud. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 show 5.5x and 4.8x energy reduction respectively compared to full-precision networks, with 65% and 52% of inferences completing at the edge. The paper provides detailed analysis of quantization effects, layer partitioning strategies, and joint optimization techniques for the hybrid architecture. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy through intelligent workload distribution between edge and cloud resources.\\narXiv ID: 2003.02838v1, Summary: This paper presents an accelerator-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for designing efficient computer vision models optimized for Google\\'s Edge TPU hardware. The authors develop a latency estimation system combining cycle-accurate simulation and analytical performance modeling to guide the NAS process. Key contributions include: (1) A search space engineering approach that incorporates hardware-friendly building blocks while excluding inefficient operations, (2) Models (EfficientNet-EdgeTPU) that achieve 10x speedup over ResNet50 on Coral Edge TPU devices while maintaining accuracy, and (3) MobileNetEdgeTPU variants that improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff by 30% on Pixel 4\\'s Edge TPU. The work demonstrates the importance of hardware-specific model optimization, showing that architectures optimized for one accelerator may perform poorly on others (e.g., EdgeTPU-optimized models underperform on mobile CPUs). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of co-designing neural networks with target hardware constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of model compression techniques for ConvNeXt models in edge computing scenarios. The authors systematically compare structured pruning (OTOV3), unstructured pruning (L1 and random), and dynamic quantization methods on CIFAR-10 image classification. Key findings include: (1) OTOV3 structured pruning achieves 60-75% reductions in model size and parameters while maintaining accuracy, (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters and MACs with minimal accuracy loss, and (3) Combining OTOV3 with quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy by 3.8%. The compressed model achieves 92.5% accuracy with 20ms inference time when deployed on edge hardware. The work provides valuable empirical insights into compression tradeoffs for modern CNN architectures on resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a neural architecture search framework optimized for edge devices with strict memory and computational constraints. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that directly incorporates device resource limits (memory or FLOPs) into the search objective. DCA-NAS achieves significant improvements over prior work: (1) It discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters), (2) Reduces search time by 4-17x compared to SOTA hardware-aware NAS methods through weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques, and (3) Demonstrates strong transferability across datasets (CIFAR-10 to ImageNet) while maintaining low latency on edge hardware like Raspberry Pi. The framework provides an efficient solution for deploying performant CNNs on diverse resource-constrained devices.\\narXiv ID: 2404.07217v2, Summary: This paper presents a novel collaborative inference framework for vision transformers (ViTs) on edge devices, addressing the challenge of maintaining server-level accuracy while minimizing communication overhead. The key innovation is a dual strategy combining: (1) Attention-aware patch selection - where the edge device\\'s lightweight ViT (DeiT-Tiny) identifies and transmits only the most relevant image patches based on attention scores, reducing communication by 68% while preserving accuracy; and (2) Entropy-aware transmission - using min-entropy to dynamically decide when to offload to the server. Experiments on ImageNet show the framework achieves 80.84% accuracy (vs 81.8% for server-only) with significantly lower latency (67.1ms vs 1184.3ms at 1Mbps). The approach uniquely leverages the edge model\\'s attention mechanism as an effective semantic encoder, even when its standalone classification performance is inferior.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents an optimized spiking neural network (SNN) approach for energy-efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a "Few-Spikes" (FS) conversion method that transforms trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) into SNNs with minimal accuracy loss while drastically reducing spike counts. The FS-neuron model uses temporal coding to emulate ANN activation functions (including SiLU and ReLU) with just 1.5-2 spikes per neuron on average. Experiments on ImageNet show the converted EfficientNet-B7 achieves 83.57% accuracy (vs 85% for ANN) while reducing spikes by 68% compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The method enables pipelined processing with new images classified every 32 time steps, significantly improving throughput over prior SNN approaches. This work demonstrates how optimized neuron models can bridge the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs for edge deployment.')\n~~~~~~~~~~\nHistory: \n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #0, Phase: plan formulation\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: \nNotes: Notes for the task objective: [{'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'You must propose an original research idea focused on optimizing models for image classification on edge devices (Edge AI).'}, {'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'Your focus will be to design **ONE** specific and feasible experiment, detailing: the proposed technique, a baseline for comparison, evaluation metrics, and the experimental environment (device and dataset).'}, {'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'Begin by clearly defining the research scope within Edge AI: identify subtopics such as popular models, edge-specific optimization techniques, quantization, structured pruning, tailored distillation, federated learning, privacy, latency, and energy consumption.'}, {'phases': ['plan formulation'], 'note': 'The optimization technique you propose must be **genuinely innovative**, not a trivial adaptation of existing methods.
