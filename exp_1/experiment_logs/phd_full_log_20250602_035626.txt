In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images.

It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Onlythe orange stages are searchable in the encoder and classifier.the classification performance improves by 1.7%, yet the denoising performanceplateaus. LPIENet denoises the worst. Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size. We co\n```\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception.

In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #2, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #2, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1).

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C.

Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net). Both the baseline and reduced DC-Net use thesame classifier (MB2.5-M Suppl. A). Whereas UNet-S and UNet are used for thereduced and baseline DC-Net respectively.Forjoiningthedenoiserandclassifier,weproposetwomodels:(i)aSequentialmodel where the classifier is attached after the denoiser (Fig. 2.i), and (ii) anIntegrated model, the classifier is attached to the UNet encoder (Fig. 2.ii). Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Forhigher noise levels, the denoising performance of the Sequential model is worse thanthe Integrated model.decoder is only optimized for denoising, since the optimization of the classifierdoes not influence it anymore. It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1). We report the metrics averaged over all 11noise levels,\u03c3 in [0, 1].L = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LChar (1)Exp 1. Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models. Both the Integratedand Sequential methods trained on the synthetic noise dataset. The integrated modelperforms significantly better in denoising and slightly worse in classification.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges.

In this paper, we considera three way trade-off between bit rate, classi\ufb01cation accuracy,and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cationsystem. Our method includes a new training strategy andan ef\ufb01cient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracyperformance. Our design can also be easily scaled accordingto different computation resources on the edge device, taking astep towards achieving rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.Under various settings, our feature coding system consistentlyoutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.Code is made publicly available 1.Index Terms\u2014Feature compression, Coding for machine vision,Image classi\ufb01cation, Edge-cloud systemI. I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4. Note that3 4 7 10 14 20 30 40 50Encoding latency on CPU (ms)121086420Delta-accuracy (%)RAC performance on ImageNetFeature coding: ours (joint)Feature coding: Entropic Student [2] (joint)Feature coding: ours (cls. fixed)Image coding: BPG [5] (cls. fixed)Image coding: Hyperpiror model [17] (cls. fixed)Image coding: Factorized model [6] (cls. fixed)Image coding: WebP (cls. fixed)Fig. 4: RAC trade-off, visualized by Delta-accuracy vs en-coding complexity. The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations. Our resulting architecture outperforms MLPerf MobileNetV1\nby 6.3% accuracy improvement with 3.5x less number of parameters on Visual Wake\nWords.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-08\narXiv paper ID: 2303.04440v2\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nneural architecture search edge devices image classification\n```.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4. Note that3 4 7 10 14 20 30 40 50Encoding latency on CPU (ms)121086420Delta-accuracy (%)RAC performance on ImageNetFeature coding: ours (joint)Feature coding: Entropic Student [2] (joint)Feature coding: ours (cls. fixed)Image coding: BPG [5] (cls. fixed)Image coding: Hyperpiror model [17] (cls. fixed)Image coding: Factorized model [6] (cls. fixed)Image coding: WebP (cls. fixed)Fig. 4: RAC trade-off, visualized by Delta-accuracy vs en-coding complexity. The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

The arrangement of the cellsfor search is given in the appendix. This derived cell saves computation andmemory overhead. A weight sharing strategy [46] among same operations withthe same originating node i to all nodes i < j < Nhas been applied within a cell.This is motivated by the observation that non-parametric operations operatingon the representation of a node produce the same feature map irrespective of theoutput node and thereby extended to parametric operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36. The target-net is trained for 600 epochs with a batchsize of 96, optimizedusing SGD with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 3e-4, and gradient clippingof 5. The initial learning rate is set to 0.025 and gradually reduced to zero usinga cosine scheduler. Additional settings include a cutout length of 16, dropoutrate of 0.2, and use of an auxiliary head. For Imagenet-1k, We reduce the inputsize from 224 \xd7 224 to 28 \xd7 28 using three convolution layers with a stride of 2.The super-net for search has 8 cells starting with 16 channels, and the target-netfor evaluation has 14 cells starting with 48 channels. Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters. In evaluation, we train for 250 epochs using--- Page 14 ---14Algorithm 1 DCA-NAS - gradient descent based search methodAssign random weights to \u03b1i,j on edges i, jdenoting weights of operations in themixed setInput look-up graph G and device memory constraint KdLook-up corresponding search memory constraint Kd\u2032 from GCalculate total search time memory size ks(\u03b1)while not convergeddoCalculate eL(w, \u03b1, \u03bb) = Lval (w(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 Kd\u2032 )Update weights w by descending \u25bdw eLtrain(w, \u03b1, \u03bb)Update \u03b1 by descending \u25bd\u03b1 eLval(w\u2217, \u03b1, \u03bb)Calculate total search time memory size ks(\u03b1)Calculate loss as in equation 4Update \u03bbend whileDerive the final architecture based on the learned \u03b1 by connecting the top weightedoperations among the mixed setthe SGD optimizer with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 3 e \u2212 5, andadopt an auxiliary head and the label smoothing technique.E Model performance by varying FLOPs constraint onCIFAR10, TinyImagenet and Imagenet-1kInstead of model parameters, we also experiment with FLOPs as the constraintin our objective function.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

The arrangement of the cellsfor search is given in the appendix. This derived cell saves computation andmemory overhead. A weight sharing strategy [46] among same operations withthe same originating node i to all nodes i < j < Nhas been applied within a cell.This is motivated by the observation that non-parametric operations operatingon the representation of a node produce the same feature map irrespective of theoutput node and thereby extended to parametric operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Right: evaluation phaseusing a cosine scheduler. Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36. The target-net is trained for 600 epochs with a batchsize of 96, optimizedusing SGD with a momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 3e-4, and gradient clippingof 5. The initial learning rate is set to 0.025 and gradually reduced to zero usinga cosine scheduler. Additional settings include a cutout length of 16, dropoutrate of 0.2, and use of an auxiliary head. For Imagenet-1k, We reduce the inputsize from 224 \xd7 224 to 28 \xd7 28 using three convolution layers with a stride of 2.The super-net for search has 8 cells starting with 16 channels, and the target-netfor evaluation has 14 cells starting with 48 channels. Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoTdevices, to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud. However,deep learning techniques like computer vision and natural language pro-cessing can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Creat-ing manual architectures specialized for each device is infeasible due totheir varying memory and computational constraints.

We present DCA-NAS, a principled method of fast neu-ral network architecture search that incorporates edge-device constraintssuch as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates weightsharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.Based on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manualarchitectures for similar sized models and is comparable to popular mo-bile architectures on various image classification datasets like CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100, and Imagenet-1k.

To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

The arrangement of the cellsfor search is given in the appendix. This derived cell saves computation andmemory overhead. A weight sharing strategy [46] among same operations withthe same originating node i to all nodes i < j < Nhas been applied within a cell.This is motivated by the observation that non-parametric operations operatingon the representation of a node produce the same feature map irrespective of theoutput node and thereby extended to parametric operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Both search and evaluationuse a batch size of 1,024. In search, we train for 50 epochs with a learning rateof 0.5 (annealed down to zero using a cosine scheduler), and a learning rate of6e \u2212 3 for architecture parameters.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures.

Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoTdevices, to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud. However,deep learning techniques like computer vision and natural language pro-cessing can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Creat-ing manual architectures specialized for each device is infeasible due totheir varying memory and computational constraints. To address theseconcerns, we automate the construction of task-specific deep learning ar-chitectures optimized for device constraints through Neural ArchitectureSearch (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled method of fast neu-ral network architecture search that incorporates edge-device constraintssuch as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates weightsharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.Based on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manualarchitectures for similar sized models and is comparable to popular mo-bile architectures on various image classification datasets like CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100, and Imagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces\u2014DARTSand NAS-Bench-201 show the generalization capabilities of DCA-NAS.On further evaluating our approach on Hardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency and state-of-the-art per-formance were discovered.Keywords: Neural Architecture Search \xb7 DARTS \xb7 Meta-Learning \xb7Edge Inference \xb7 Constrained Optimization1 IntroductionIn recent years, there has been significant progress in developing Deep NeuralNetwork (DNN) architectures [33,47,34] for edge and mobile devices.However,designing DNN architectures for specific hardware constraints and tasks is atime-consuming and computationally expensive process [3]. To address this, Neu-ral Architecture Search (NAS) [2,32,49] has become popular as it discovers op-timal architectures given a task and network operations. Despite its success,traditional NAS techniques cannot guarantee optimal architecture for specificdevices with hardware constraints such as storage memory and maximum sup-ported FLOPs. To address this concern, researchers have developed hardware-aware algorithms [36,4] that find optimal device architectures with low resourcearXiv:2307.04443v1  [cs.CV]  10 Jul 2023--- Page 2 ---2 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet AgarwalFig. 1: DCA-NAS framework:Weight sharing in the search space and Derived cellslowers the search time from other DNAS. Target device constraint is used to querysearch constraint from look-up graph for constrained optimization.training overhead and search time. These methods often use inference latency [4],FLOPs [36] or a combination of hardware metrics [36] as constraints scaled bya tunable factor. However, the time to tune the scaling factor is often not con-sidered within the NAS search time and can be ten times the reported searchtime. To address these issues, we propose the Device Constraints-Aware NAS(DCA-NAS), a principled differentiable NAS method that introduces total al-lowable model size or floating-point operations (FLOPs) as constraints withinthe optimization problem, with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Unlike infer-ence latency which is task dependent, FLOPs and memory are specified with agiven hardware and thus are appropriate for our generic method. The approachis adaptable to other hardware metrics such as energy consumption or infer-ence latency using additional metric-measuring functions. The paper make thefollowing significant contributions:\u2013 It introduces a fast method that uses weight sharing among operations inthe search space and channel bottleneck, along with a differentiable resourceconstraint, for continuous exploration of the search space.\u2013 A training pipeline that allows a user to input device memory or FLOPs andsearch for optimal architecture with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.\u2013 Our extensive experimentation on vision datasets- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,TinyImagenet, Imagenet-1k and inference-latency comparisons of trainedmodels on Hardware-NAS-bench demonstrate the efficiency of our method.The generalization of our method to different search spaces is shown withexperiments on DARTS and NAS-Bench.2 Related WorkNeural Architecture Search Popular approaches [12,22,1] designed architec-tures for high performance on specific tasks or datasets with the traditionaldeep learning perspective that bigger is better, resulting in computationallyand memory-intensive inference on edge devices. Network pruning [13], chan-nels removal [26,34] and weights/activations quantization [8,50] can compress--- Page 3 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 3architectures, but require pre-training, hyperparameter tuning, and often lacktransferability.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods such as Reinforce-ment Learning [30,4], Evolutionary Learning [11,21] and Differentiable NeuralArchitecture Search (DNAS) [25,43] can automatically search for architectureswithout user intervention, and can transfer across similar tasks. DNAS withsurrogate metrics [42,48] have also been used to explore the architecture searchspace. However, architectures found by DNAS methods are not optimized fordeployment on edge devices and smaller models obtained by reducing layers orchannels are often sub-optimal.Hardware-aware Neural Architecture search Certain NAS methods opti-mize [4,40,3,19] for constraints such as latency, inference speed [41], FLOPS [36,37],memory usage [24]. Some use a separate DNN to predict constraint metrics andevolutionary search to obtain hardware-aware optimal models [36,3], while oth-ers consider real-time latencies of edge devices or provide specific architecturesfor specific devices [27,7]. However, these methods require significant search timeand tuning of scaling factors controlling the trade-off between the performanceand the constraint, and do not always account for optimal architectures. In con-trast, we use a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with generichardware metrics, and do not require a tunable scaling factor. Certain meth-ods [3,29,9] train a supernet first and then search for a smaller architecture,but this is only efficient when there are more than fifteen different edge deviceswith different limitations or deployment scenarios [3] as training the supernettakes huge resources-32 V100s taking about 1,200 GPU hours. Search stage fol-lowed by evaluation, as done in our approach is more efficient when the differentnumber of possible edge devices is less than fifteen.3 DCA-NAS: Device Constraints Aware Fast NeuralArchitecture SearchWe present the preliminary gradient-based NAS objective function in section 3.1and then formulate the problem of incorporating the hardware-awareness in NASas a constrained optimization problem in section 3.2 followed by techniquesto reduce the search time in section 3.3. The framework of our approach isillustrated in Figure 1.3.1 Gradient-based NAS Objective FunctionPopular DNAS techniques [25,46] have two stages, the search phase and the eval-uation phase. During the search phase, given a task or a dataset the techniquessearch for a network of cells, which are directed acyclic graphs withN nodes. Theedges of the graph are network layers, whose operations are to be selected froma pre-defined set O containing operations such as 3x3 separable convolution andidentity operations with trainable weights wo. The search is made differentiableby making the choice of a particular operation to be a softmax of architectureweights \u03b1 of all operations. Thus, the intermediate output zj at node j is givenby,zj =Xo\u2208Oexp\u03b1i,joPo\u2032\u2208O exp\u03b1i,jo\u2032 \xb7 owi,jo , zi(1)--- Page 4 ---4 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal3.2 DCA-NAS formulationPrevious DNAS approaches [25,45,46] did not focus on searching architecturesspecifically for inference on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, we for-mulate the DNAS objective function as a constrained optimization problem byincorporating device resource constraints (memory or FLOPs) in the search ob-jective function. The constrained bi-level optimization problem is written as,min\u03b1 Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1)s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1)s.t. ks(\u03b1) \u2264 Kd(2)where training dataset is split into train and val to optimize w and \u03b1 simultane-ously in each iteration subject to the constraint that the architecture\u2019s numberof parameters or FLOPs ks must be less than or equal to the device resourceconstraint Kd. The following equation calculates the architecture\u2019s number ofparameters or FLOPs during search given the number of cells cn . Our methodcan also be adapted to use other metrics such as latency and energy consumptionwith additional metric measuring functions.ks(\u03b1) = cnX(i,j)\u2208NXo\u2208Oexp{\u03b1i,jo } \u2217b (o)Po\u2032\u2208O exp{\u03b1i,jo\u2032 }(3)Tackling the difference in search and evaluation networks The size ofthe architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architecture size inevaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3 (demonstra-tion can be found in the appendix). To address this, we introduce a tighter boundon the search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraintKd. A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032within appropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence eachtime to obtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computa-tion time of the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel. Thus,on incorporating the tighter constraint by looking-up the graph for the givendevice resource constraint Kd along with the trainable Lagrange multiplier \u03bb inEquation 2, the objective function is re-written as,eL = Lval (w\u2217(\u03b1), \u03b1) + \u03bb(ks(\u03b1) \u2212 LUG(Kd))s.t. w\u2217(\u03b1) = argminw Ltrain (w, \u03b1) (4)3.3 Techniques to reduce search timeChannel Bottleneck We use convolutional layers of 1x1 kernel to reduce thedepth of output channels of operations in the search space to save computationtime and memory overhead.Derived Cell and Weight sharing. During architecture search, only one cellwith trainable \u03b1 is used to optimize architecture parameters. The target networkfor inference is built by stacking cells with architectures derived from highlyweighted operations. This can be done during search by deriving the other cell--- Page 5 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 5Table 1: Performance comparison of architectures evaluated on visual datasets-CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet. \u2019(CIFAR-10)\u2019 indicates search with CIFAR-10. \u2019X M\u2019 in\u2019DCA-NAS-X M\u2019 denotes the input memory constraint.

The arrangement of the cellsfor search is given in the appendix. This derived cell saves computation andmemory overhead. A weight sharing strategy [46] among same operations withthe same originating node i to all nodes i < j < Nhas been applied within a cell.This is motivated by the observation that non-parametric operations operatingon the representation of a node produce the same feature map irrespective of theoutput node and thereby extended to parametric operations.

We transferthe architecture searched on CIFAR-10 to train and evaluate the model weightson TinyImagenet in Table 1 and ImageNet-1k in Table 2. This transferred modelyields higher performance than manually designed architectures [33,28] for thetarget dataset. It is observed that performance of the transferred model is com-parable to the architecture searched on the target dataset itself which can beattributed to the architecture learning coarse features than objects during search.Performance versus Device-Constraints trade-off DCA-NAS discovers2 to 4% better-performing architectures than manual designs with a memoryconstraint of 3.5 million parameters on CIFAR-10 and similar performance onTinyImagenet as in Table 1. On Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields models with sim-ilar performance to other NAS methods [42,6,45] with a constraint of 5.5 millionparameters (taken to yield similar sized models as other NAS methods) as in Ta-ble 2. We vary the input device resource constraint and plot the performance ofthe searched models against the number of parameters in Figure 2. As observed,DCA-NAS searched models can yield 15x lower sized models than manual ar-chitectures like PyramidNet-272 [12] with at most 1% reduction in accuracy onCIFAR-10. On TinyImagenet, DCA-NAS yields models similar in performancebut 6x smaller in size than the manual Resnet variant. In comparison to Prox-ylessNAS [4] for Imagenet-1k, DCA-NAS yields 32% smaller model in terms ofmodel parameters for similar accuracy. In comparison to DNAS methods [25,45]for each of the three datasets, we observe that the performance of the DCA-NASsearched models is retained to a certain extent as resources are further limited--- Page 7 ---Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search 7Fig. 3: Plots show DCA-NAS searched models with similar performance but lowerinference latency (on two devices- Pixel 3 and Raspberry Pi 4) to previous SOTA NASmethod- PC-DARTS when evaluated on NAS-Bench dataset.after which the model performance degrades. DCA-NAS model of similar size hasthe advantage of better performance (by 1%) and being automatically searchedover MobileNet-v2 [33], a manually designed network on Imagenet-1k.Search time comparison For evaluation on TinyImagenet in Table 1, thearchitecture searched on CIFAR-10 with DCA-NAS yields model in the low-est search time which indicates the search-time efficiency of the transferabilityproperty. Our method requires about 4x lower search cost than SGAS [23] whichperforms the best among the other transferred architectures and 16x lower searchtime than the other resource-constrained approach [20] for similar performanceas seen in Table 2. Moreover, ProxylessNAS [4] takes about 4x more search timethan DCA-NAS whereas PC-DARTS takes about 2x more search time with nocapability to constraint model size.4.2 Results on NAS-Bench-201 search spacePerformance and Latency comparisons on different devicesOur methodreports the mean by averaging over five runs with different random seed. Figure3 compares the performance of models searched with DCA-NAS and PC-DARTSby varying the latency constraints. It shows that unlike PC-DARTS, DCA-NAScan search for more efficient models which have lower inference latency for similartest accuracy. Moreover, we observe that models with similar performance havelower latency when tested on Pixel 3 than on Raspberry Pi 4 due to a fasterRAM in Pixel 3. DCA-NAS takes the lowest search time among all the NASmethods due to the addition of search-time-efficient techniques while being at-par in terms of performance across all datasets.5 Ablation StudyEffectiveness of various algorithmic augmentations for faster search:We analyze the effectiveness of algorithmic augmentations mentioned preciously 3.3to reduce search cost in our study. We sequentially add weight sharing, channelbottleneck, and derived cells to the baseline DARTS [25] method and measuresearch time and accuracy. Weight sharing, channel bottleneck, and derived cellswas observed to significantly reduce search memory overhead, enabling us to uselarger batch sizes and reducing overall search cost as seen in Figure 4a. Addingthe resource-constraint in the final DCA-NAS method negligibly increases search--- Page 8 ---8 Oshin Dutta, Tanu Kanvar, and Sumeet Agarwal(a) (b)Fig. 4: (a) Ablation study with CIFAR-10 dataset- Each component added to DARTSleads to the reduction in the search cost of DCA-NAS while performance is retained.WS- Weight Sharing, CB- Channel Bottleneck, DC- Derived Cell, RC- Resource Con-straint, BS- Batch Size (b) Shows stability of performance of DCA-NAS searched mod-els for runs with varying seeds on CIFAR-10 dataset.cost while maintaining performance.Stability of the approach: We test stability by running the search algorithmindependently five times with different initial seeds and the same constraints andhyperparameters. The architectures found during each run have similar perfor-mance when re-trained and evaluated as shown in Fig. 4b. Smaller models havelower performance due to restrictions in model complexity compared to largermodels.6 ConclusionWe present DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture searchframework which discovers architectures optimized to the memory and compu-tational constraints of an edge device in a time-efficient manner. It does so byincorporating a constraint in terms of the number of parameters or floating pointoperations (FLOPs) in the objective function with the help of a Lagrange multi-plier. DCA-NAS in essence searches for a Pareto optimal solution given the edgedevice memory or FLOPs constraint. Moreover, it enables architecture searchwith search cost 4 to 17 times lower than the previous state-of-the-art Hardware-aware NAS approaches. DCA-NAS can discover models with size about 10 to15 times lower than manually designed architectures for similar performance.In comparison to DARTS and its other NAS variants, DCA-NAS can discovermodels upto 3x smaller in size with similar performance. This hardware-awareapproach can be generalized to any future updates to differential neural architec-ture search and possibly to training-free methods of NAS with some adaptation.AcknowledgementWe thank the anonymous reviewers; Profs.

Zhu, C., Han, S., Mao, H., Dally, W.J.: Trained ternary quantization (2017)--- Page 12 ---AppendixA Deriving cell architecturesThe searched cells are stacked to form the network whose weights are trained andevaluated. The layers of this network during the evaluation phase is varied from4 to 20. It can be seen that the models searched with DARTS with only 2-cellsperform equally well as those of 8-cell search for target model with layers morethan 10. Hence, in our experiments, instead of training architecture parametersfor all 8 cells, we train only 2 cells- one normal and the other reduction cell. Thearchitecture of the other 6 cells stacked to form the network during search arederived from either the normal or the reduction cell as shown in Figure 1.B Calculation of search-stage architecture sizeThe size of the architecture in the search phase ks is different from the architec-ture size in evaluation phase due to the softmax weighting factor in equation 3(demonstrated in Figure 2). To address this, we introduce a tighter bound onthe search constraint Kd\u2032 , which is less than the device resource constraint Kd.A lookup graph (LUG) needs to be made for each dataset by varying Kd\u2032 withinappropriate bounds and running the algorithm until convergence each time toobtain the corresponding device resource constraint Kd. The computation timeof the LUG can be reduced by running the searches in parallel.C AlgorithmThe practical implementation of our resource-constrained gradient descent-basedapproach is illustrated in Algrorithm 1.D Implementation DetailsThe experiments with the smaller vision datasets-MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Imagenet-16-120 and TinyImagenet were run on a single Tesla V100 GPU.Training and evaluation on Imagenet-1k was performed on a cluster containingeight V100 GPUs.The super-net used for search with smaller vision datasets except Imagenet-1kconsists of 8 cells, with 6 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial num-ber of channels set to 16. Each cell has 6 nodes, with the first 2 nodes in cell kserving as input nodes. The super-net is trained for 50 epochs with a batchsizeof 512, and optimized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of3e \u2212 4. The learning rate is initially set to 0.2 and gradually reduced to zero--- Page 13 ---Appendix 13Fig. 1: Top: shows the regular DARTS cell with nodes connected by weighted opera-tions and the derived cell made of top-weighted operations.

Architecture parameters \u03b1 are optimized using Adamoptimizer, with a learning rate of 6 e \u2212 4, a momentum of (0 .5, 0.999), and aweight decay of 1e \u2212 3. The search is run 5 times, and the architecture with thehighest validation accuracy is chosen. For evaluation, the target-net has 20 cells,with 18 normal cells and 2 reduction cells, and an initial number of channels setto 36.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Code is availableat https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.1 IntroductionDynamic neural networks [7] have attracted great research interests in recent years. Compared tostatic models [11, 17, 13, 23] which treat different inputs equally during inference, dynamic networkscan allocate the computation in a data-dependent manner. For example, they can conditionally skipthe computation of network layers [ 15, 9, 32, 30] or convolutional channels [ 19, 1], or performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative image regions ( e.g. the foreground areas)[6, 5, 31, 35, 33, 8]. Spatial-wise dynamic networks, which typically decide whether to computeeach feature pixel with masker modules [5, 31, 35, 8] (Figure 1 (a)), have shown promising results inimproving the inference ef\ufb01ciency of convolution neural networks (CNNs).Despite the remarkable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency achieved by spatial-wise dynamic networks [5, 31, 35],researchers have found it challenging to translate the theoretical results into realistic speedup,\u2217Equal contribution.\u2020Corresponding author.36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2210.06223v1  [cs.CV]  12 Oct 2022--- Page 2 ---Maskergather ...convolution(s) scatter...Dynamic Convolution(s) AlgorithmSchedulingHardwareLatency(a) Algorithm: Spatially adaptive inference with a masker.(b) Scheduling: the practical inference pipeline of dynamic convolutions.(c) The general idea of our work.in\ufb02uence guidanceselected pixel locationsFigure 1: An overview of our method. (a) illustrates the spatially adaptive inference algorithm; (b) isthe scheduling strategy; and (c) presents the three key factors to the practical latency. For a givenhardware, the latency is used to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.especially on some multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs [35, 3, 8]. The challenges are two-fold: 1) mostprevious approaches [5, 31, 35] perform spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest granularity: everypixel is \ufb02exibly decided whether to be computed or not. Such \ufb02exibility induces non-contiguousmemory access [35] and requires specialized scheduling strategies (Figure 1 (b)); 2) the existingliterature has only adopted the hardware-agnostic FLOPs (\ufb02oating-point operations) as an inaccurateproxy for the ef\ufb01ciency, lacking latency-aware guidance on the algorithm design. For dynamicnetworks, the adaptive computation with sub-optimal scheduling strategies further enlarges thediscrepancy between the theoretical FLOPs and the practical latency. Note that it has been validatedby previous works that the latency on CPUs has a strong correlation with FLOPs [8, 35]. Therefore,we mainly focus on the GPU platform in this paper, which is more challenging and less explored.We address the above challenges by proposing a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet). Three key factors to the inference latency are considered: the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties. Given a target hardware device, we directly use the latency,rather than the FLOPs, to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization (Figure 1 (c)).Because the memory access pattern and the scheduling strategies in our dynamic operators differfrom those in static networks, the libraries developed for static models (e.g. cuDNN) are sub-optimalfor the acceleration of dynamic models. Without the support of libraries, each dynamic operatorrequires scheduling optimization, code optimization, compiling, and deployment for each device.Therefore, it is laborious to evaluate the network latency on different hardware platforms. To this end,we propose a novel latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the realistic latency of a networkby simultaneously considering the aforementioned three factors. Compared to the hardware-agnosticFLOPs, our predicted latency can better re\ufb02ect the practical ef\ufb01ciency of dynamic models.Guided by this latency prediction model, we establish our latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet), which adaptively decides whether to allocate computation on feature patches insteadof pixels [5, 31, 35] (Figure 2 top). We name this paradigm as spatially adaptive inference at acoarse granularity. While less \ufb02exible than the pixel-level adaptive computation in previous works[5, 31, 35], it facilitates more contiguous memory access, bene\ufb01ting the realistic speedup on hardware.The scheduling strategy and the implementation are further ameliorated for faster inference.It is worth noting that LASNet is designed as a general framework in two aspects: 1) the coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference paradigm can be conveniently implemented in various CNNbackbones, e.g., ResNets [11], DenseNets [17] and RegNets [25]; and 2) the latency predictor is anoff-the-shell tool which can be directly used for various computing platforms (e.g. server GPUs andedge devices).We evaluate the performance of LASNet on multiple CNN architectures on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Experiment results show that our LASNet improvesthe ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs both theoretically and practically. For example, the inference latencyof ResNet-101 on ImageNet [ 4] is reduced by 36% and 46% on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU andan Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, respectively, without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy. Moreover, the proposedmethod outperforms various lightweight networks in a low-FLOPs regime.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:2--- Page 3 ---1. We propose LASNet, which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference guidedby the practical latency instead of the theoretical FLOPs. To the best of our knowledge,LASNet is the \ufb01rst framework that directly considers the real latency in the design phase ofdynamic neural networks;2. We propose a latency prediction model, which can ef\ufb01ciently and accurately estimate thelatency of dynamic operators by simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties;3. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation and downstream tasks verify that our proposed LAS-Net can effectively improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency of different CNN architectures.2 Related worksSpatial-wise dynamic network is a common type of dynamic neural networks [ 7]. Compared tostatic models which treat different feature locations evenly during inference, these networks performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative regions ( e.g., foregrounds), and reduce theunnecessary computation on less important areas (e.g., backgrounds). Existing works mainly includethree levels of dynamic computation: resolution level [ 36, 37], region level [ 33] and pixel level[5, 31, 35]. The former two generally manipulate the network inputs [ 33, 37] or require specialarchitecture design [36]. In contrast, pixel-level dynamic networks can \ufb02exibly skip the convolutionson certain feature pixels in arbitrary CNN backbones [5, 31, 35]. Despite its remarkable theoreticalef\ufb01ciency, pixel-wise dynamic computation brings considerable dif\ufb01culty to achieving realisticspeedup on multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs. Compared to the previous approaches [ 5, 31, 35]which only focus on reducing the theoretical computation, we propose to directly use the latency toguide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.Hardware-aware network design. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical ef\ufb01ciencyof deep models, researchers have started to consider the real latency in the network design phase.There are two lines of works in this direction. One directly performs speed tests on targeteddevices, and summarizes some guidelines to facilitate hand-designing lightweight models [23]. Theother line of work searches for fast models using the neural architecture search (NAS) technique[29, 34]. However, all existing works try to build static models, which have intrinsic computationalredundancy by treating different inputs in the same way. However, speed tests for dynamic operatorson different hardware devices can be very laborious and impractical. In contrast, our proposed latencyprediction model can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the inference latency on any given computing platforms bysimultaneously considering algorithm design, scheduling strategies and hardware properties.3 MethodologyIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the preliminaries of spatially adaptive inference, and then demon-strate the architecture design of our LASNet. The latency prediction model is then explained, whichguides the granularity settings and the scheduling optimization for LASNet. We further present theimplementation improvements for faster inference, followed by the training strategies.3.1 PreliminariesSpatially adaptive inference. The existing spatial-wise dynamic networks are usually establishedby attaching a masker Min each convolutional block of a CNN backbone (Figure 1 (a)). Speci\ufb01cally,let x\u2208RH\xd7W\xd7C denote the input of a block, where H and W are the feature height and width, andC is the channel number. The masker Mtakes x as input, and generates a binary-valued spatialmask M = M(x) \u2208{0,1}H\xd7W . Each element of M determines whether to perform convolutionoperations on the corresponding location of the output feature. The unselected regions will be \ufb01lledwith the values from the input [5, 31] or obtained via interpolation [35]. We de\ufb01ne the activation rateof a block as r=\u2211i,j Mi,jH\xd7W , representing the ratio of the calculated pixels.Scheduling strategy. During inference, the current scheduling strategy for spatial-wise dynamicconvolutions generally involve three steps [26] (Figure 1 (b)): 1) gathering, which re-organizes theselected pixels (if the convolution kernel size is greater than 1 \xd71, the neighbors are also required)along the batch dimension; 2) computation, which performs convolution on the gathered input; and3) scattering, which \ufb01lls the computed pixels on their corresponding locations of the output feature.3--- Page 4 ---MaskerMasker-Conv1x1 Conv1x1 ...Scatter-Add Conv1x1 Conv3x3 Gumbel NoiseT raining Inference Input OutputUpsample Element-wise  multiplication Selected pixelGather-Conv3x3 Conv1x1 Regular convolution Operator fusionInput OutputFigure 2: Our proposed LASNet block. Top: we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution spatial mask Mcoarse,which is then upsampled to obtain the mask M with the same size as the output feature. GumbelSoftmax [18, 24] is used for end-to-end training (Sec. 3.5). Bottom: the scheduling optimization isperformed to decrease the memory access for faster inference (Sec. 3.4).Limitations. Compared to performing convolutions on the entire feature map, the aforementionedscheduling strategy reduces the computation while bringing considerable overhead to memory accessdue to the mask generation and the non-contiguous memory access. Such overhead would increasethe overall latency, especially when the granularity of dynamic convolution is at the \ufb01nest pixel level.3.2 Architecture designSpatial granularity. As mentioned above, pixel-level dynamic convolutions [5, 31, 35] raise sub-stantial challenges to achieving realistic speedup on multi-core processors due to the non-contiguousmemory access. To this end, we propose to optimize the granularity of spatially adaptive inference.Speci\ufb01cally, take the commonly used bottleneck structure in [11] as an example, our coarse-grainedspatial-wise dynamic convolutional block is illustrated in Figure 2. Instead of directly producinga mask with the shape of H\xd7W, we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution mask Mcoarse \u2208{0,1}HS \xd7WS ,where Sis named as the spatial granularity. Each element in Mcoarse determines the computationof an S\xd7S-sized feature patch. For instance, the feature size in the \ufb01rst ResNet stage3 is 56 \xd756.Then the possible choices for Sare {1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56}.The mask Mcoarse is then upsampledto the size of H\xd7W. Notably, S = 1means that the granularity is still at the pixel level as previousmethods [5, 31, 35]. Note that the other extreme situation (S = 56) is not considered in this paper,when the masker directly determines whether to skip the whole block (i.e. layer skipping [30, 32]).Such an overly aggressive approach will lead to considerable drop of accuracy, as we presented inAppendix C.2. The masker is composed of a pooling layer followed by a 1 \xd71 convolution.Differences to existing works. Without using the interpolation operation [ 35] or the carefullydesigned two-branch structure [8], the proposed block architecture is simple and suf\ufb01ciently generalto be plugged into most backbones with minimal modi\ufb01cation. Our formulation is mostly similar tothat in [31], which could be viewed as a variant of our method with the spatial granularity S=1 for allblocks. Instead of performing spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest pixel level, our granularity Sisoptimized under the guidance of our latency prediction model (details are presented in the followingSec. 4.2) to achieve realistic speedup on target computing platforms.3.3 Latency prediction modelAs stated before, it is laborious to evaluate the latency of dynamic operators on different hardwareplatforms. To ef\ufb01ciently seek preferable granularity settings on arbitrary hardware devices, wepropose a latency prediction model G, which can directly predict the delay of executing dynamicoperators on any target devices. For a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, the latency predictorGtakes the hardware propertiesH, the layer parametersP, the spatial granularityS, and the activationrate ras input and predicts the latency \u2113of a dynamic convolutional block: \u2113= G(H,P,S,r ).Hardware modeling. We model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs), and parallelcomputation can be executed on these PEs. As shown in Figure 3, we model the memory system as a3Here we refer to a stage as the cascading of multiple blocks which process features with the same resolution.4--- Page 5 ---Off-chip Memory(GDDR/DDR/HBM)On-chip Memory(LLC/Global Buffer)PE1PEMemoryComputation UnitsPE2PEMemoryComputation UnitsPEnPEMemoryComputation Units\u2026Figure 3: Our hardware model.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)101520253035Latency ( s)PredictedReal Figure 4: Latency prediction results.three-level structure [12]: 1) off-chip memory, 2) on-chip global memory, and 3) memory in PE. Sucha hardware model enables us to accurately predict the cost on both data movement and computation.Latency prediction. When simulating the data movement procedure, the ef\ufb01ciency of non-contiguous memory accesses under different granularity Ssettings is considered. As for the com-putation latency, it is important to adopt a proper scheduling strategy to increase the parallelism ofcomputation. Therefore, we search for the optimal scheduling (the con\ufb01guration of tiling and in-PEparallel computing) of dynamic operations to maximize the utilization of hardware resources. A moredetailed description of our latency prediction model is presented in Appendix A.Empirical validation. We take the \ufb01rst block in ResNet-101 as an example and vary the activationrate rto evaluate the performance of our prediction model. The comparison between our predictionsand the real testing latency on the Nvidia V100 GPU is illustrated in Figure 4, from which we canobserve that our predictor can accurately estimate the real latency in a wide range of activation rates.3.4 Implementation detailsWe use general optimization methods like fusing activation functions and batch normalizationlayers into convolution layers. We also optimize the speci\ufb01c operators in our spatial-wise dynamicconvolutional blocks as follows (see also Figure 2 for an overview).Fusing the masker and the \ufb01rst convolution. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, the masker in each blockconsumes very little computation, but it takes the whole feature map as input. Therefore, it is amemory-bounded operation (the inference time is mainly spent on memory access). Since the maskerand the \ufb01rst convolution in the block share the same input, there is an opportunity to fuse these twooperations to avoid the repeated access of the input data. Note that a spatial-wise dynamic convolutionrequires the output of the masker. If we fuse the two layers, the \ufb01rst convolution will be changed to astatic operation, which may increase the inference latency. There exists a threshold of activation raterth, when r>r th, the overall latency can be reduced. We decide whether to fuse them according tothe average activation rate. See more details in Appendix B.1.Fusing the gather operation and the dynamic convolution. Traditional approaches \ufb01rst gather theinput pixels of the \ufb01rst dynamic convolution in a block (Figure 1 (b)). The gather operation is alsoa memory-bounded operation. Furthermore, when the size of the convolution kernel exceeds 1\xd71,the area of input patches may overlap, resulting in repeated memory load/store. We fuse the gatheroperation into the dynamic convolution to reduce the memory access.Fusing the scatter operation and the add operation. Traditional approaches scatter the outputpixels of the last dynamic convolution, and then execute the element-wise addition (Figure 1 (b)). Wefuse these two operators to reduce the memory access. The ablation study in Sec. 4.4 validates theeffectiveness of the proposed fusing methods.3.5 TrainingOptimization of non-differentiable maskers. The masker modules are required to produce binary-valued spatial masks for making discrete decisions, and cannot be directly optimized with backpropagation. Following [35, 31, 8], we adopt straight-through Gumbel Softmax [18, 24] to train thenetwork in an end-to-end fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, let \u02dcM \u2208RH\xd7W\xd72 denote the output of the maskgenerator. The decisions are obtained with the argmax function during inference. In the trainingphase, a differentiable approximation is de\ufb01ned by replacing the argmax operation with a Softmax:\u02c6M =exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,0)+ G:,:,0)/\u03c4}\u22111k=0 exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,k)+ G:,:,k)/\u03c4} \u2208 [0,1]H\xd7W , (1)5--- Page 6 ---0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-ResNet blocks on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Latency ratio (r )S = 1(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 5: Latency prediction results of LAS-ResNet blocks on V100 (a) and LAS-RegNet blocks onTX2 (b). For both networks, we plot the relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the activationrate r for the blocks in 4 stages with the convolutional stride 1. The practical ef\ufb01ciency is onlyimproved when r\u2113 <1. Note that S = 1can harm the practical latency even for a small r(reducedcomputation), while a larger Swill alleviate this problem. See detailed analysis in Sec. 4.2.where \u03c4 is the Softmax temperature. Following the common practice [ 31, 8], we let \u03c4 decreaseexponentially from 5.0 to 0.1 in training to facilitate the optimization of maskers.Training objective. The FLOPs of each spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block can be calculatedbased on our de\ufb01ned activation rate r[31]. Then we can obtain the FLOPs of the overall dynamicnetwork Fdyn. Let Fstat denotes the FLOPs of its static counterpart. We optimize their ratio toapproximate a target 0 <t< 1:LFLOPs = (FdynFstat\u2212t)2.In addition, we de\ufb01ne loss item Lbounds asin [31] to constrain the upper bound and the lower bound of activation rates in early training epochs.We further propose to leverage the static counterparts of our dynamic networks as \u201cteachers\u201d to guidethe optimization procedure. Let y and y\u2032denote the output logits of a dynamic model (\u201cstudent\u201d)and its \u201cteacher\u201d, respectively. Our \ufb01nal loss can be written asL= Ltask + \u03b1(LFLOPs + Lbounds) +\u03b2T2 \xb7KL(\u03c3(y/T)||\u03c3(y\u2032/T)), (2)where Ltask represents the task-related loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss in image classi\ufb01cation. KL(\xb7||\xb7)denotes the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, and \u03b1,\u03b2 are the coef\ufb01cients balancing these items. We use\u03c3to denote the log-Softmax function, and T is the temperature for computing KL-divergence.4 ExperimentsIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the experiment settings in Sec. 4.1. Then the latency of differentgranularity settings are analyzed in Sec. 4.2. The performance of our LASNet on ImageNet is furtherevaluated in Sec. 4.3, followed by the ablation studies in Sec. 4.4. Visualization results are illustratedin Sec. 4.5, and we \ufb01nally validate our method on the object detection task (Sec. 4.6). The results onthe instance segmentation task are presented in . For simplicity, we add \u201cLAS-\u201d as a pre\ufb01x beforemodel names to denote our LASNet, e.g., LAS-ResNet-50.4.1 Experiment settingsLatency prediction. Various types of hardware platforms are tested, including a server GPU (TeslaV100), a desktop GPU (GTX1080) and edge devices ( e.g., Nvidia Nano and Jetson TX2). Themajor properties considered by our latency prediction model include the number of processingengines (#PE), the \ufb02oating-point computation in a processing engine (#FP32), the frequency and thebandwidth. It can be observed that the server GPUs generally have a larger #PE than the IoT devices.The batch size is set as 1 for all dynamic models and computing platforms.Image classi\ufb01cation. The image classi\ufb01cation experiments are conducted on the ImageNet [ 4]dataset. Following [31], we initialize the backbone parameter from a pre-trained checkpoint4, and4We use the torchvision pre-trained models at https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.6--- Page 7 ---1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)12345Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.0Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-ResNet blocks on V100.1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 6: The relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the spatial granularity S.\ufb01netune the whole network for 100 epochs with the loss function in Eq. (2). We \ufb01x \u03b1= 10,\u03b2 = 0.5and T = 4.0 for all dynamic models. More details are provided in Appendix B.4.2 Latency prediction resultsIn this subsection, we present the latency prediction results of the spatial-wise dynamic convolutionalblocks in two different models: LAS-ResNet-101 [11] (on V100) and LAS-RegNetY-800MF [25] (onTX2). All the blocks have the bottleneck structure with different channel numbers and convolutiongroups, and the RegNetY is equipped with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [14] modules.We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne \u2113dyn as the latency of a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, and \u2113stat as that ofa static block without a masker. Their ratio is denoted as r\u2113 = \u2113dyn\u2113stat. We investigate the relationshipbetween r\u2113 and the activation rate r(cf. Sec. 3.5) for different granularity settings. The results inFigure 5 demonstrate that: 1) even equipped with our special optimization on the scheduling strategies,pixel-level spatially adaptive inference (S=1) cannot always improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency. Such\ufb01ne-grained adaptive inference is adopted by most previous works [31, 35], and our result can explainthe reason why they can only achieve realistic speedup on less powerful CPUs [35] or specializeddevices [3]; 2) a proper granularity S >1 effectively alleviates this problem on both hardwaredevices. By setting S >1, realistic speedup could be achieved with larger activation rates.The latency prediction results are further used to seek for a preferable granularity setting for the\ufb01rst 3 stages (we \ufb01x S = 1 for the last stage, where the feature resolution is 7 \xd77). Therefore,we plot the relationship between r\u2113 and S in Figure 10. It can be observed that: 1) r\u2113 generallydecreases with Sincreasing for a given r; 2) an overly largeS(less \ufb02exible adaptive inference) bringsinsigni\ufb01cant improvement on both devices. Especially, enlarging S from 8 to 28 in the \ufb01rst stageof a LAS-ResNet brings very little improvement on V100. Based on the results in Figure 10, wecan trade off between \ufb02exibility and ef\ufb01ciency by selecting appropriate Sfor different models andhardware devices. For example, we can simply set Snet=8-4-7-15 in a LAS-ResNet-101 to achiverealistic speedup. The accuracy-latency plots in Figure 7 also validate this observation. More resultsof our latency prediction model on the desktop-level GPU, GTX1080, are presented in Appendix C.1.4.3 ImageNet classi\ufb01cation resultsWe now empirically evaluate our proposed LASNet on the ImageNet dataset. The network perfor-mance is measured in terms of the trade-off between classi\ufb01cation accuracy and inference ef\ufb01ciency.Both theoretical (i.e. FLOPs) and practical ef\ufb01ciency (i.e. latency) are tested in our experiments.5We use this form to represnet the Ssettings for the 4 stages of a network.7--- Page 8 ---2 3 4 5 6 7 8FLOPs (x1e9)73747576777879Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101SkipNet-ResNet-101BAS-ResNet-50DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)15 20 25 30 35 40Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)(a) LAS-ResNet results.0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8FLOPs (x1e9)717273747576Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2ShuffleNets-v2CondenseNetsLAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)3 4 5 6 7 8Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)8 10 12 14 16 18 20Latency on Nvidia nano GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-YRegNets-XMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)(b) LAS-RegNetY results.Figure 7: Experimental results on ImageNet.

We apply the same operator fusion (Sec. 3.4) for bothour models and the compared baselines [30, 31] for fair comparison.Results are presented in Figure 7 (a). On the left we plot the relationship of accuracy v.s. FLOPs. Itcan be observed that our LAS-ResNets with different granularity settings signi\ufb01cantly outperformthe competing dynamic neural networks. Surprisingly, coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1 for the 4 stages) can achieve even higher accuracy when consumingsimilar FLOPs on ResNets, despite the sacri\ufb01ced \ufb02exibility compared toSnet=1-1-1-1. We conjecturethat a larger Sis also bene\ufb01cial to the optimization of maskers.We compare the practical latency of three granularity settings in Figure 7 (a) predicted by our latencyprediction model (middle on TX2 and right on V100). We can witness that although they achievecomparable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency (Figure 7 (a) left), larger Sis more hardware-friendly comparedto the \ufb01nest granularity. For example, the inference latency of LAS-ResNet-101 ( Snet=1-1-1-1)is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the ResNet-101 baseline on V100 (Figure 7 (a) right), even though itstheoretical computation is much smaller than that of the static model. However, larger granularities(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1) can effectively improve the inference latency due to its lower burdenon the memory access. Remarkably, the latency of ResNet-101 could be reduced by 36% and 46% onV100 and TX2 respectively without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy when t=0.4. The classi\ufb01cation accuracyis increased by 1.9% with similar inference ef\ufb01ciency. It can be observed that the realistic speedupratio r\u2113 is more close to the theoretical FLOPs ratio target ton the less powerful TX2, because thelatency is computation-bounded (i.e. the latency is mainly spent on computation) on such IoT devices.In contrast, there is a larger gap between practical and theoretical ef\ufb01ciency on the more powerfulV100, as the latency is bounded by the memory access cost.4.3.2 Lightweight baseline comparison: RegNetsWe further evaluate our LASNet in lightweight CNN architectures,i.e. RegNets-Y [25]. Two differentsized models are tested: RegNetY-400MF and RegNetY-800MF. Compared baselines include othertypes of ef\ufb01cient models, e.g., MobileNets-v2 [28], Shuf\ufb02etNets-v2 [23] and CondenseNets [16].The results are presented in Figure 7 (b). The x-axis for the three sub-\ufb01gures are the FLOPs, thelatency on TX2, and the latency on the Nvidia nano GPU, respectively. We can observe that our8--- Page 9 ---1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%) static ResNetsLAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)Figure 8: Ablation studies on S.

More results on image classi\ufb01cation are provided in Appendix C.2.4.4 Ablation studiesWe conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our coarse-grained spatially adaptiveinference (Sec. 3.2) and operator fusion operations (Sec. 3.4).More granularities settings. We test various granularity settings on LAS-ResNet-101 to examinethe effects of Sin different stages. The results on the Tesla-V100 GPU are presented in Figure 8. Itcan be found that the \ufb01nest granularity (Snet=1-1-1-1) leads to substantial inef\ufb01ciency despite thereduced FLOPs (cf. Figure 7 (a) left). Coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference in the \ufb01rst twostages (Snet=4-4-1-1) effectively reduces the inference latency. We further increase Sin the thirdstage to 2 and 7, and this procedure consistently improves the realistic ef\ufb01ciency on the V100 GPU.This trend also holds on the GTX 1080 GPU (see the results in Appendix C.2.Table 1: Ablation studies on operator fusion.Masker- Gather- Scatter- LatencyConv1x1 Conv3x3 Add (\xb5s)   163.2   90.1   86.7   71.4Operator fusion. We investigate the effect of ouroperator fusion introduced in Sec. 3.4. One convolu-tional block in the \ufb01rst stage of a LAS-ResNet-101(S=4, r=0.6) is tested. The results in Table 1 vali-date that every step of operator fusion bene\ufb01ts thepractical latency of a block, as the overhead onmemory access is effectively reduced. Especially,the fusion of the masker operation and the \ufb01rst con-volution is crucial to reducing the latency.4.5 VisualizationWe visualize the masks generated by our masker in the third block of a LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1) in Figure 12. The brilliant areas correspond to the locations of 1 elements in a mask, andthe computation on the dimmed regions is skipped by our dynamic model. We can witness that themasker accurately locate the most task-related regions (even the tiny aircraft at the corner), whichhelps reduce the unnecessary computation on background areas. These resultsalso suggest that forthe \ufb01rst stage, the granularity S=4 is suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02exible to recognize the important regions, anda win-win can be achieved between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. Interestingly, the masker could selectsome objects that are not labeled for the sample, e.g., the \ufb02ower beside the hummingbird and thehuman holding the camera. This indicates that our spatial-wise dynamic networks can automaticallyrecognize the regions with semantics, and their capability is not limited by the classi\ufb01cation labels.This property is helpful in some downstream tasks, such as object detection (Sec. 4.6) and instancesegmentation (Sec. 4.7), which require detecting multiple classes and objects in an image. Morevisualization results could be found in Appendix C.3.4.6 COCO Object detectionWe further evaluate our LASNet on the COCO [22] object detection task. The mean average precision(mAP), the average backbone FLOPs, and the average backbone latency on the validation set areused to measure the network performance. We test two commonly used detection frameworks: FasterR-CNN [27] with Feature Pyramid Network [20] and RetinaNet [21]. Thanks to the generality ofour method, we can conveniently replace the backbones with ours pre-trained on ImageNet, andthe whole models are \ufb01netuned on COCO with the standard setting for 12 epochs (see detailed9--- Page 10 ---Table 2: Object detection results on the COCO dataset.Detection Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)mAP (%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Faster R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 39.4LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.6) 90.7 33.8 90.6 524.9 40.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 79.3 30.7 82.5 477.1 39.8LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.5 29.0 79.9 464.8 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 67.9 25.3 69.1 401.3 39.5RetinaNetResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 38.5LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 77.8 30.4 81.8 472.6 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.4 28.9 79.9 464.8 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 66.4 25.3 69.1 401.3 38.9Table 3: Instance Segmentation results on the COCO dataset.Segmentation Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)APmask(%) APbox(%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Mask R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 80.5 31.1 83.3 481.9 37.0 41.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.4) 69.2 27.9 74.8 431.6 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 68.8 25.8 70.9 411.8 36.2 40.0setup in Appendix B.3).

We can observe from the results that when setting the training target as 0.4, the latency ofour LAS-ResNet-101 with Snet=4-4-7-1 is signi\ufb01cantly lower than the static baseline on all deviceswithout sacri\ufb01cing mAP in both detection frameworks. With a larger training targets, our LASNetcan increase the mAP by 0.9% and 0.8% in Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet respectively, while stillbeing faster than the baseline method.4.7 COCO instance segmentationWe also present the results of instance segmentation on COCO, which demonstrate the effectivenessof our LASNet on the dense prediction task. From the results in Table 3, we can observe that whensetting the training target as 0.4, the Mask R-CNN [ 10] models (Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=4-4-7-1)runs faster on all tested hardware devices without sacri\ufb01cing the performance. With a training targetof 0.5, the APmask and APbox of the Mask R-CNN model could be increased by 0.9% and 1.0%respectively while still running faster than the baseline method.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we propose to build latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic networks (LASNet) under theguidance of a latency prediction model. By simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy and the hardware properties, we can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the practical latency of spatial-wise dynamic operators on arbitrary computing platforms. Based on the empirical analysis on therelationship between the latency and the granularity of spatially adaptive inference, we optimizeboth the algorithm and the scheduling strategies to achieve realistic speedup on many multi-coreprocessors, e.g., the Tesla V100 GPU and the Jetson TX2 GPU. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection and instance segmentation tasks validate that the proposed method signi\ufb01cantlyimproves the practical ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs, and outperforms various competing approaches.AcknowledgementThis work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant2020AAA0105200, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62022048and the Tsinghua University-China Mobile Communications Group Co.,Ltd.

NeurIPS, 2021.12--- Page 13 ---AppendixA Latency prediction model.As the dynamic operators in our method have not been supported by current deep learning libraries,we propose a latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the real latency of these operators onhardware device. The inputs of the latency prediction model include: 1) the structural con\ufb01gurationof a convolutional block, 2) its activation rate rwhich decides the computation amount, 3) the spatialgranularity S, and 4) the hardware properties mentioned in Table 4. The latency of a dynamic blockis predicted as follows.Input/output shape de\ufb01nition. The \ufb01rst step of predicting the latency of an operation is to calculatethe shape of input and output. Taking the gather-conv2 operation as an example, the input of thisoperation is the activation with the shape of Cin \xd7H \xd7W, where Cin is the number of inputchannels, and H and W are the resolution of the feature map. The shape of the output tensor isP \xd7Cout \xd7S\xd7S, where P is the number of output patches, Cout is the number of output channelsand Sis the spatial granularity. Note that P is obtained based on the output of our maskers.Operation-to-hardware mapping. Next, we map the operations to hardware. As is mentioned in thepaper, we model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs). We assign the computationof each element in the output feature map to a PE. Speci\ufb01cally, we consecutively split the outputfeature map into multiple tiles. The shape of each tile is TP \xd7TC \xd7TS1 \xd7TS2. These split tilesare assigned to multiple PEs. The computation of the elements in each tile is executed in a PE. Wecan con\ufb01gure different shapes of tiles. In order to determine the optimal shape of the tile, we makea search space of different tile shapes. The tile shape has 4 dimensions. The candidates of eachdimension are power-of-2 and do not exceed the corresponding dimension of the feature map.Latency estimation. Then, we evaluate the latency of each tile shape in the search space and selectthe optimal tile shape with the lowest latency. The latency includes the data movement latency andthe computation latency: \u2113= \u2113data + \u2113computation.1) Data movement latency \u2113data. The estimation of the latency for data movement requires us tomodel the memory system of a hardware device. We model the memory system of hardware as athree-level architecture [12]: off-chip memory, on-chip global memory, and local memory in PE.The input data and weight data are \ufb01rst transferred from the off-chip memory to the on-chip globalmemory. We assume the hardware can make full use of the off-chip memory bandwidth to simplifythe latency prediction model.After that, the data used to compute the output tiles is transferred from on-chip global memory tothe local m\n```\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```.

Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #6, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nneural architecture search edge devices image classification\n```\nStep #7, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query neural architecture search edge devices image classification, here was the response\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device.

Code is availableat https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.1 IntroductionDynamic neural networks [7] have attracted great research interests in recent years. Compared tostatic models [11, 17, 13, 23] which treat different inputs equally during inference, dynamic networkscan allocate the computation in a data-dependent manner. For example, they can conditionally skipthe computation of network layers [ 15, 9, 32, 30] or convolutional channels [ 19, 1], or performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative image regions ( e.g. the foreground areas)[6, 5, 31, 35, 33, 8]. Spatial-wise dynamic networks, which typically decide whether to computeeach feature pixel with masker modules [5, 31, 35, 8] (Figure 1 (a)), have shown promising results inimproving the inference ef\ufb01ciency of convolution neural networks (CNNs).Despite the remarkable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency achieved by spatial-wise dynamic networks [5, 31, 35],researchers have found it challenging to translate the theoretical results into realistic speedup,\u2217Equal contribution.\u2020Corresponding author.36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2210.06223v1  [cs.CV]  12 Oct 2022--- Page 2 ---Maskergather ...convolution(s) scatter...Dynamic Convolution(s) AlgorithmSchedulingHardwareLatency(a) Algorithm: Spatially adaptive inference with a masker.(b) Scheduling: the practical inference pipeline of dynamic convolutions.(c) The general idea of our work.in\ufb02uence guidanceselected pixel locationsFigure 1: An overview of our method. (a) illustrates the spatially adaptive inference algorithm; (b) isthe scheduling strategy; and (c) presents the three key factors to the practical latency. For a givenhardware, the latency is used to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.especially on some multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs [35, 3, 8]. The challenges are two-fold: 1) mostprevious approaches [5, 31, 35] perform spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest granularity: everypixel is \ufb02exibly decided whether to be computed or not. Such \ufb02exibility induces non-contiguousmemory access [35] and requires specialized scheduling strategies (Figure 1 (b)); 2) the existingliterature has only adopted the hardware-agnostic FLOPs (\ufb02oating-point operations) as an inaccurateproxy for the ef\ufb01ciency, lacking latency-aware guidance on the algorithm design. For dynamicnetworks, the adaptive computation with sub-optimal scheduling strategies further enlarges thediscrepancy between the theoretical FLOPs and the practical latency. Note that it has been validatedby previous works that the latency on CPUs has a strong correlation with FLOPs [8, 35]. Therefore,we mainly focus on the GPU platform in this paper, which is more challenging and less explored.We address the above challenges by proposing a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet). Three key factors to the inference latency are considered: the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties. Given a target hardware device, we directly use the latency,rather than the FLOPs, to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization (Figure 1 (c)).Because the memory access pattern and the scheduling strategies in our dynamic operators differfrom those in static networks, the libraries developed for static models (e.g. cuDNN) are sub-optimalfor the acceleration of dynamic models. Without the support of libraries, each dynamic operatorrequires scheduling optimization, code optimization, compiling, and deployment for each device.Therefore, it is laborious to evaluate the network latency on different hardware platforms. To this end,we propose a novel latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the realistic latency of a networkby simultaneously considering the aforementioned three factors. Compared to the hardware-agnosticFLOPs, our predicted latency can better re\ufb02ect the practical ef\ufb01ciency of dynamic models.Guided by this latency prediction model, we establish our latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet), which adaptively decides whether to allocate computation on feature patches insteadof pixels [5, 31, 35] (Figure 2 top). We name this paradigm as spatially adaptive inference at acoarse granularity. While less \ufb02exible than the pixel-level adaptive computation in previous works[5, 31, 35], it facilitates more contiguous memory access, bene\ufb01ting the realistic speedup on hardware.The scheduling strategy and the implementation are further ameliorated for faster inference.It is worth noting that LASNet is designed as a general framework in two aspects: 1) the coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference paradigm can be conveniently implemented in various CNNbackbones, e.g., ResNets [11], DenseNets [17] and RegNets [25]; and 2) the latency predictor is anoff-the-shell tool which can be directly used for various computing platforms (e.g. server GPUs andedge devices).We evaluate the performance of LASNet on multiple CNN architectures on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Experiment results show that our LASNet improvesthe ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs both theoretically and practically. For example, the inference latencyof ResNet-101 on ImageNet [ 4] is reduced by 36% and 46% on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU andan Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, respectively, without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy. Moreover, the proposedmethod outperforms various lightweight networks in a low-FLOPs regime.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:2--- Page 3 ---1. We propose LASNet, which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference guidedby the practical latency instead of the theoretical FLOPs. To the best of our knowledge,LASNet is the \ufb01rst framework that directly considers the real latency in the design phase ofdynamic neural networks;2. We propose a latency prediction model, which can ef\ufb01ciently and accurately estimate thelatency of dynamic operators by simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties;3. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation and downstream tasks verify that our proposed LAS-Net can effectively improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency of different CNN architectures.2 Related worksSpatial-wise dynamic network is a common type of dynamic neural networks [ 7]. Compared tostatic models which treat different feature locations evenly during inference, these networks performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative regions ( e.g., foregrounds), and reduce theunnecessary computation on less important areas (e.g., backgrounds). Existing works mainly includethree levels of dynamic computation: resolution level [ 36, 37], region level [ 33] and pixel level[5, 31, 35]. The former two generally manipulate the network inputs [ 33, 37] or require specialarchitecture design [36]. In contrast, pixel-level dynamic networks can \ufb02exibly skip the convolutionson certain feature pixels in arbitrary CNN backbones [5, 31, 35]. Despite its remarkable theoreticalef\ufb01ciency, pixel-wise dynamic computation brings considerable dif\ufb01culty to achieving realisticspeedup on multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs. Compared to the previous approaches [ 5, 31, 35]which only focus on reducing the theoretical computation, we propose to directly use the latency toguide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.Hardware-aware network design. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical ef\ufb01ciencyof deep models, researchers have started to consider the real latency in the network design phase.There are two lines of works in this direction. One directly performs speed tests on targeteddevices, and summarizes some guidelines to facilitate hand-designing lightweight models [23]. Theother line of work searches for fast models using the neural architecture search (NAS) technique[29, 34]. However, all existing works try to build static models, which have intrinsic computationalredundancy by treating different inputs in the same way. However, speed tests for dynamic operatorson different hardware devices can be very laborious and impractical. In contrast, our proposed latencyprediction model can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the inference latency on any given computing platforms bysimultaneously considering algorithm design, scheduling strategies and hardware properties.3 MethodologyIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the preliminaries of spatially adaptive inference, and then demon-strate the architecture design of our LASNet. The latency prediction model is then explained, whichguides the granularity settings and the scheduling optimization for LASNet. We further present theimplementation improvements for faster inference, followed by the training strategies.3.1 PreliminariesSpatially adaptive inference. The existing spatial-wise dynamic networks are usually establishedby attaching a masker Min each convolutional block of a CNN backbone (Figure 1 (a)). Speci\ufb01cally,let x\u2208RH\xd7W\xd7C denote the input of a block, where H and W are the feature height and width, andC is the channel number. The masker Mtakes x as input, and generates a binary-valued spatialmask M = M(x) \u2208{0,1}H\xd7W . Each element of M determines whether to perform convolutionoperations on the corresponding location of the output feature. The unselected regions will be \ufb01lledwith the values from the input [5, 31] or obtained via interpolation [35]. We de\ufb01ne the activation rateof a block as r=\u2211i,j Mi,jH\xd7W , representing the ratio of the calculated pixels.Scheduling strategy. During inference, the current scheduling strategy for spatial-wise dynamicconvolutions generally involve three steps [26] (Figure 1 (b)): 1) gathering, which re-organizes theselected pixels (if the convolution kernel size is greater than 1 \xd71, the neighbors are also required)along the batch dimension; 2) computation, which performs convolution on the gathered input; and3) scattering, which \ufb01lls the computed pixels on their corresponding locations of the output feature.3--- Page 4 ---MaskerMasker-Conv1x1 Conv1x1 ...Scatter-Add Conv1x1 Conv3x3 Gumbel NoiseT raining Inference Input OutputUpsample Element-wise  multiplication Selected pixelGather-Conv3x3 Conv1x1 Regular convolution Operator fusionInput OutputFigure 2: Our proposed LASNet block. Top: we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution spatial mask Mcoarse,which is then upsampled to obtain the mask M with the same size as the output feature. GumbelSoftmax [18, 24] is used for end-to-end training (Sec. 3.5). Bottom: the scheduling optimization isperformed to decrease the memory access for faster inference (Sec. 3.4).Limitations. Compared to performing convolutions on the entire feature map, the aforementionedscheduling strategy reduces the computation while bringing considerable overhead to memory accessdue to the mask generation and the non-contiguous memory access. Such overhead would increasethe overall latency, especially when the granularity of dynamic convolution is at the \ufb01nest pixel level.3.2 Architecture designSpatial granularity. As mentioned above, pixel-level dynamic convolutions [5, 31, 35] raise sub-stantial challenges to achieving realistic speedup on multi-core processors due to the non-contiguousmemory access. To this end, we propose to optimize the granularity of spatially adaptive inference.Speci\ufb01cally, take the commonly used bottleneck structure in [11] as an example, our coarse-grainedspatial-wise dynamic convolutional block is illustrated in Figure 2. Instead of directly producinga mask with the shape of H\xd7W, we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution mask Mcoarse \u2208{0,1}HS \xd7WS ,where Sis named as the spatial granularity. Each element in Mcoarse determines the computationof an S\xd7S-sized feature patch. For instance, the feature size in the \ufb01rst ResNet stage3 is 56 \xd756.Then the possible choices for Sare {1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56}.The mask Mcoarse is then upsampledto the size of H\xd7W. Notably, S = 1means that the granularity is still at the pixel level as previousmethods [5, 31, 35]. Note that the other extreme situation (S = 56) is not considered in this paper,when the masker directly determines whether to skip the whole block (i.e. layer skipping [30, 32]).Such an overly aggressive approach will lead to considerable drop of accuracy, as we presented inAppendix C.2. The masker is composed of a pooling layer followed by a 1 \xd71 convolution.Differences to existing works. Without using the interpolation operation [ 35] or the carefullydesigned two-branch structure [8], the proposed block architecture is simple and suf\ufb01ciently generalto be plugged into most backbones with minimal modi\ufb01cation. Our formulation is mostly similar tothat in [31], which could be viewed as a variant of our method with the spatial granularity S=1 for allblocks. Instead of performing spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest pixel level, our granularity Sisoptimized under the guidance of our latency prediction model (details are presented in the followingSec. 4.2) to achieve realistic speedup on target computing platforms.3.3 Latency prediction modelAs stated before, it is laborious to evaluate the latency of dynamic operators on different hardwareplatforms. To ef\ufb01ciently seek preferable granularity settings on arbitrary hardware devices, wepropose a latency prediction model G, which can directly predict the delay of executing dynamicoperators on any target devices. For a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, the latency predictorGtakes the hardware propertiesH, the layer parametersP, the spatial granularityS, and the activationrate ras input and predicts the latency \u2113of a dynamic convolutional block: \u2113= G(H,P,S,r ).Hardware modeling. We model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs), and parallelcomputation can be executed on these PEs. As shown in Figure 3, we model the memory system as a3Here we refer to a stage as the cascading of multiple blocks which process features with the same resolution.4--- Page 5 ---Off-chip Memory(GDDR/DDR/HBM)On-chip Memory(LLC/Global Buffer)PE1PEMemoryComputation UnitsPE2PEMemoryComputation UnitsPEnPEMemoryComputation Units\u2026Figure 3: Our hardware model.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)101520253035Latency ( s)PredictedReal Figure 4: Latency prediction results.three-level structure [12]: 1) off-chip memory, 2) on-chip global memory, and 3) memory in PE. Sucha hardware model enables us to accurately predict the cost on both data movement and computation.Latency prediction. When simulating the data movement procedure, the ef\ufb01ciency of non-contiguous memory accesses under different granularity Ssettings is considered. As for the com-putation latency, it is important to adopt a proper scheduling strategy to increase the parallelism ofcomputation. Therefore, we search for the optimal scheduling (the con\ufb01guration of tiling and in-PEparallel computing) of dynamic operations to maximize the utilization of hardware resources. A moredetailed description of our latency prediction model is presented in Appendix A.Empirical validation. We take the \ufb01rst block in ResNet-101 as an example and vary the activationrate rto evaluate the performance of our prediction model. The comparison between our predictionsand the real testing latency on the Nvidia V100 GPU is illustrated in Figure 4, from which we canobserve that our predictor can accurately estimate the real latency in a wide range of activation rates.3.4 Implementation detailsWe use general optimization methods like fusing activation functions and batch normalizationlayers into convolution layers. We also optimize the speci\ufb01c operators in our spatial-wise dynamicconvolutional blocks as follows (see also Figure 2 for an overview).Fusing the masker and the \ufb01rst convolution. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, the masker in each blockconsumes very little computation, but it takes the whole feature map as input. Therefore, it is amemory-bounded operation (the inference time is mainly spent on memory access). Since the maskerand the \ufb01rst convolution in the block share the same input, there is an opportunity to fuse these twooperations to avoid the repeated access of the input data. Note that a spatial-wise dynamic convolutionrequires the output of the masker. If we fuse the two layers, the \ufb01rst convolution will be changed to astatic operation, which may increase the inference latency. There exists a threshold of activation raterth, when r>r th, the overall latency can be reduced. We decide whether to fuse them according tothe average activation rate. See more details in Appendix B.1.Fusing the gather operation and the dynamic convolution. Traditional approaches \ufb01rst gather theinput pixels of the \ufb01rst dynamic convolution in a block (Figure 1 (b)). The gather operation is alsoa memory-bounded operation. Furthermore, when the size of the convolution kernel exceeds 1\xd71,the area of input patches may overlap, resulting in repeated memory load/store. We fuse the gatheroperation into the dynamic convolution to reduce the memory access.Fusing the scatter operation and the add operation. Traditional approaches scatter the outputpixels of the last dynamic convolution, and then execute the element-wise addition (Figure 1 (b)). Wefuse these two operators to reduce the memory access. The ablation study in Sec. 4.4 validates theeffectiveness of the proposed fusing methods.3.5 TrainingOptimization of non-differentiable maskers. The masker modules are required to produce binary-valued spatial masks for making discrete decisions, and cannot be directly optimized with backpropagation. Following [35, 31, 8], we adopt straight-through Gumbel Softmax [18, 24] to train thenetwork in an end-to-end fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, let \u02dcM \u2208RH\xd7W\xd72 denote the output of the maskgenerator. The decisions are obtained with the argmax function during inference. In the trainingphase, a differentiable approximation is de\ufb01ned by replacing the argmax operation with a Softmax:\u02c6M =exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,0)+ G:,:,0)/\u03c4}\u22111k=0 exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,k)+ G:,:,k)/\u03c4} \u2208 [0,1]H\xd7W , (1)5--- Page 6 ---0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-ResNet blocks on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Latency ratio (r )S = 1(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 5: Latency prediction results of LAS-ResNet blocks on V100 (a) and LAS-RegNet blocks onTX2 (b). For both networks, we plot the relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the activationrate r for the blocks in 4 stages with the convolutional stride 1. The practical ef\ufb01ciency is onlyimproved when r\u2113 <1. Note that S = 1can harm the practical latency even for a small r(reducedcomputation), while a larger Swill alleviate this problem.

Following the common practice [ 31, 8], we let \u03c4 decreaseexponentially from 5.0 to 0.1 in training to facilitate the optimization of maskers.Training objective. The FLOPs of each spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block can be calculatedbased on our de\ufb01ned activation rate r[31]. Then we can obtain the FLOPs of the overall dynamicnetwork Fdyn. Let Fstat denotes the FLOPs of its static counterpart. We optimize their ratio toapproximate a target 0 <t< 1:LFLOPs = (FdynFstat\u2212t)2.In addition, we de\ufb01ne loss item Lbounds asin [31] to constrain the upper bound and the lower bound of activation rates in early training epochs.We further propose to leverage the static counterparts of our dynamic networks as \u201cteachers\u201d to guidethe optimization procedure. Let y and y\u2032denote the output logits of a dynamic model (\u201cstudent\u201d)and its \u201cteacher\u201d, respectively. Our \ufb01nal loss can be written asL= Ltask + \u03b1(LFLOPs + Lbounds) +\u03b2T2 \xb7KL(\u03c3(y/T)||\u03c3(y\u2032/T)), (2)where Ltask represents the task-related loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss in image classi\ufb01cation. KL(\xb7||\xb7)denotes the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, and \u03b1,\u03b2 are the coef\ufb01cients balancing these items. We use\u03c3to denote the log-Softmax function, and T is the temperature for computing KL-divergence.4 ExperimentsIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the experiment settings in Sec. 4.1. Then the latency of differentgranularity settings are analyzed in Sec. 4.2. The performance of our LASNet on ImageNet is furtherevaluated in Sec. 4.3, followed by the ablation studies in Sec. 4.4. Visualization results are illustratedin Sec. 4.5, and we \ufb01nally validate our method on the object detection task (Sec. 4.6). The results onthe instance segmentation task are presented in . For simplicity, we add \u201cLAS-\u201d as a pre\ufb01x beforemodel names to denote our LASNet, e.g., LAS-ResNet-50.4.1 Experiment settingsLatency prediction. Various types of hardware platforms are tested, including a server GPU (TeslaV100), a desktop GPU (GTX1080) and edge devices ( e.g., Nvidia Nano and Jetson TX2). Themajor properties considered by our latency prediction model include the number of processingengines (#PE), the \ufb02oating-point computation in a processing engine (#FP32), the frequency and thebandwidth. It can be observed that the server GPUs generally have a larger #PE than the IoT devices.The batch size is set as 1 for all dynamic models and computing platforms.Image classi\ufb01cation. The image classi\ufb01cation experiments are conducted on the ImageNet [ 4]dataset. Following [31], we initialize the backbone parameter from a pre-trained checkpoint4, and4We use the torchvision pre-trained models at https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.6--- Page 7 ---1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)12345Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.0Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-ResNet blocks on V100.1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 6: The relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the spatial granularity S.\ufb01netune the whole network for 100 epochs with the loss function in Eq. (2). We \ufb01x \u03b1= 10,\u03b2 = 0.5and T = 4.0 for all dynamic models. More details are provided in Appendix B.4.2 Latency prediction resultsIn this subsection, we present the latency prediction results of the spatial-wise dynamic convolutionalblocks in two different models: LAS-ResNet-101 [11] (on V100) and LAS-RegNetY-800MF [25] (onTX2). All the blocks have the bottleneck structure with different channel numbers and convolutiongroups, and the RegNetY is equipped with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [14] modules.We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne \u2113dyn as the latency of a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, and \u2113stat as that ofa static block without a masker. Their ratio is denoted as r\u2113 = \u2113dyn\u2113stat. We investigate the relationshipbetween r\u2113 and the activation rate r(cf. Sec. 3.5) for different granularity settings. The results inFigure 5 demonstrate that: 1) even equipped with our special optimization on the scheduling strategies,pixel-level spatially adaptive inference (S=1) cannot always improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency. Such\ufb01ne-grained adaptive inference is adopted by most previous works [31, 35], and our result can explainthe reason why they can only achieve realistic speedup on less powerful CPUs [35] or specializeddevices [3]; 2) a proper granularity S >1 effectively alleviates this problem on both hardwaredevices. By setting S >1, realistic speedup could be achieved with larger activation rates.The latency prediction results are further used to seek for a preferable granularity setting for the\ufb01rst 3 stages (we \ufb01x S = 1 for the last stage, where the feature resolution is 7 \xd77). Therefore,we plot the relationship between r\u2113 and S in Figure 10. It can be observed that: 1) r\u2113 generallydecreases with Sincreasing for a given r; 2) an overly largeS(less \ufb02exible adaptive inference) bringsinsigni\ufb01cant improvement on both devices. Especially, enlarging S from 8 to 28 in the \ufb01rst stageof a LAS-ResNet brings very little improvement on V100. Based on the results in Figure 10, wecan trade off between \ufb02exibility and ef\ufb01ciency by selecting appropriate Sfor different models andhardware devices. For example, we can simply set Snet=8-4-7-15 in a LAS-ResNet-101 to achiverealistic speedup. The accuracy-latency plots in Figure 7 also validate this observation. More resultsof our latency prediction model on the desktop-level GPU, GTX1080, are presented in Appendix C.1.4.3 ImageNet classi\ufb01cation resultsWe now empirically evaluate our proposed LASNet on the ImageNet dataset. The network perfor-mance is measured in terms of the trade-off between classi\ufb01cation accuracy and inference ef\ufb01ciency.Both theoretical (i.e. FLOPs) and practical ef\ufb01ciency (i.e. latency) are tested in our experiments.5We use this form to represnet the Ssettings for the 4 stages of a network.7--- Page 8 ---2 3 4 5 6 7 8FLOPs (x1e9)73747576777879Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101SkipNet-ResNet-101BAS-ResNet-50DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)15 20 25 30 35 40Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)(a) LAS-ResNet results.0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8FLOPs (x1e9)717273747576Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2ShuffleNets-v2CondenseNetsLAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)3 4 5 6 7 8Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)8 10 12 14 16 18 20Latency on Nvidia nano GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-YRegNets-XMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)(b) LAS-RegNetY results.Figure 7: Experimental results on ImageNet. The proposed coarse-grained spatially adaptive inferenceis tested on standard ResNets (a) and lightweight RegNets (b).4.3.1 Standard baseline comparison: ResNetsWe \ufb01rst establish our LASNet based on the standard ResNets [ 11]. Speci\ufb01cally, we build LAS-ResNet-50 and LAS-ResNet-101 by plugging our maskers in the two common ResNet structures.The baselines include various types of dynamic inference approaches: 1) layer skipping (SkipNet[32] and Conv-AIG [30]); 2) channel skipping (BAS [1]); and 3) pixel-level spatial-wise dynamicnetwork (DynConv [31]). For our LASNet, we compare various settings of the spatial granularitySnet. We set training targets (cf. Sec. 3.5) t\u2208{0,4,0.5,0.6,0.7}for our dynamic models to evaluatetheir performance in different sparsity regimes. We apply the same operator fusion (Sec. 3.4) for bothour models and the compared baselines [30, 31] for fair comparison.Results are presented in Figure 7 (a). On the left we plot the relationship of accuracy v.s. FLOPs. Itcan be observed that our LAS-ResNets with different granularity settings signi\ufb01cantly outperformthe competing dynamic neural networks. Surprisingly, coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1 for the 4 stages) can achieve even higher accuracy when consumingsimilar FLOPs on ResNets, despite the sacri\ufb01ced \ufb02exibility compared toSnet=1-1-1-1. We conjecturethat a larger Sis also bene\ufb01cial to the optimization of maskers.We compare the practical latency of three granularity settings in Figure 7 (a) predicted by our latencyprediction model (middle on TX2 and right on V100). We can witness that although they achievecomparable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency (Figure 7 (a) left), larger Sis more hardware-friendly comparedto the \ufb01nest granularity. For example, the inference latency of LAS-ResNet-101 ( Snet=1-1-1-1)is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the ResNet-101 baseline on V100 (Figure 7 (a) right), even though itstheoretical computation is much smaller than that of the static model. However, larger granularities(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1) can effectively improve the inference latency due to its lower burdenon the memory access. Remarkably, the latency of ResNet-101 could be reduced by 36% and 46% onV100 and TX2 respectively without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy when t=0.4. The classi\ufb01cation accuracyis increased by 1.9% with similar inference ef\ufb01ciency. It can be observed that the realistic speedupratio r\u2113 is more close to the theoretical FLOPs ratio target ton the less powerful TX2, because thelatency is computation-bounded (i.e. the latency is mainly spent on computation) on such IoT devices.In contrast, there is a larger gap between practical and theoretical ef\ufb01ciency on the more powerfulV100, as the latency is bounded by the memory access cost.4.3.2 Lightweight baseline comparison: RegNetsWe further evaluate our LASNet in lightweight CNN architectures,i.e. RegNets-Y [25]. Two differentsized models are tested: RegNetY-400MF and RegNetY-800MF. Compared baselines include othertypes of ef\ufb01cient models, e.g., MobileNets-v2 [28], Shuf\ufb02etNets-v2 [23] and CondenseNets [16].The results are presented in Figure 7 (b). The x-axis for the three sub-\ufb01gures are the FLOPs, thelatency on TX2, and the latency on the Nvidia nano GPU, respectively.

More results on image classi\ufb01cation are provided in Appendix C.2.4.4 Ablation studiesWe conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our coarse-grained spatially adaptiveinference (Sec. 3.2) and operator fusion operations (Sec. 3.4).More granularities settings. We test various granularity settings on LAS-ResNet-101 to examinethe effects of Sin different stages. The results on the Tesla-V100 GPU are presented in Figure 8. Itcan be found that the \ufb01nest granularity (Snet=1-1-1-1) leads to substantial inef\ufb01ciency despite thereduced FLOPs (cf. Figure 7 (a) left). Coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference in the \ufb01rst twostages (Snet=4-4-1-1) effectively reduces the inference latency. We further increase Sin the thirdstage to 2 and 7, and this procedure consistently improves the realistic ef\ufb01ciency on the V100 GPU.This trend also holds on the GTX 1080 GPU (see the results in Appendix C.2.Table 1: Ablation studies on operator fusion.Masker- Gather- Scatter- LatencyConv1x1 Conv3x3 Add (\xb5s)   163.2   90.1   86.7   71.4Operator fusion. We investigate the effect of ouroperator fusion introduced in Sec. 3.4. One convolu-tional block in the \ufb01rst stage of a LAS-ResNet-101(S=4, r=0.6) is tested. The results in Table 1 vali-date that every step of operator fusion bene\ufb01ts thepractical latency of a block, as the overhead onmemory access is effectively reduced. Especially,the fusion of the masker operation and the \ufb01rst con-volution is crucial to reducing the latency.4.5 VisualizationWe visualize the masks generated by our masker in the third block of a LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1) in Figure 12. The brilliant areas correspond to the locations of 1 elements in a mask, andthe computation on the dimmed regions is skipped by our dynamic model. We can witness that themasker accurately locate the most task-related regions (even the tiny aircraft at the corner), whichhelps reduce the unnecessary computation on background areas. These resultsalso suggest that forthe \ufb01rst stage, the granularity S=4 is suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02exible to recognize the important regions, anda win-win can be achieved between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. Interestingly, the masker could selectsome objects that are not labeled for the sample, e.g., the \ufb02ower beside the hummingbird and thehuman holding the camera. This indicates that our spatial-wise dynamic networks can automaticallyrecognize the regions with semantics, and their capability is not limited by the classi\ufb01cation labels.This property is helpful in some downstream tasks, such as object detection (Sec. 4.6) and instancesegmentation (Sec. 4.7), which require detecting multiple classes and objects in an image. Morevisualization results could be found in Appendix C.3.4.6 COCO Object detectionWe further evaluate our LASNet on the COCO [22] object detection task. The mean average precision(mAP), the average backbone FLOPs, and the average backbone latency on the validation set areused to measure the network performance. We test two commonly used detection frameworks: FasterR-CNN [27] with Feature Pyramid Network [20] and RetinaNet [21].

With a training targetof 0.5, the APmask and APbox of the Mask R-CNN model could be increased by 0.9% and 1.0%respectively while still running faster than the baseline method.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we propose to build latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic networks (LASNet) under theguidance of a latency prediction model. By simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy and the hardware properties, we can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the practical latency of spatial-wise dynamic operators on arbitrary computing platforms. Based on the empirical analysis on therelationship between the latency and the granularity of spatially adaptive inference, we optimizeboth the algorithm and the scheduling strategies to achieve realistic speedup on many multi-coreprocessors, e.g., the Tesla V100 GPU and the Jetson TX2 GPU. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection and instance segmentation tasks validate that the proposed method signi\ufb01cantlyimproves the practical ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs, and outperforms various competing approaches.AcknowledgementThis work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant2020AAA0105200, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62022048and the Tsinghua University-China Mobile Communications Group Co.,Ltd.

NeurIPS, 2021.12--- Page 13 ---AppendixA Latency prediction model.As the dynamic operators in our method have not been supported by current deep learning libraries,we propose a latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the real latency of these operators onhardware device. The inputs of the latency prediction model include: 1) the structural con\ufb01gurationof a convolutional block, 2) its activation rate rwhich decides the computation amount, 3) the spatialgranularity S, and 4) the hardware properties mentioned in Table 4. The latency of a dynamic blockis predicted as follows.Input/output shape de\ufb01nition. The \ufb01rst step of predicting the latency of an operation is to calculatethe shape of input and output. Taking the gather-conv2 operation as an example, the input of thisoperation is the activation with the shape of Cin \xd7H \xd7W, where Cin is the number of inputchannels, and H and W are the resolution of the feature map. The shape of the output tensor isP \xd7Cout \xd7S\xd7S, where P is the number of output patches, Cout is the number of output channelsand Sis the spatial granularity. Note that P is obtained based on the output of our maskers.Operation-to-hardware mapping. Next, we map the operations to hardware. As is mentioned in thepaper, we model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs). We assign the computationof each element in the output feature map to a PE. Speci\ufb01cally, we consecutively split the outputfeature map into multiple tiles. The shape of each tile is TP \xd7TC \xd7TS1 \xd7TS2. These split tilesare assigned to multiple PEs. The computation of the elements in each tile is executed in a PE. Wecan con\ufb01gure different shapes of tiles. In order to determine the optimal shape of the tile, we makea search space of different tile shapes. The tile shape has 4 dimensions. The candidates of eachdimension are power-of-2 and do not exceed the corresponding dimension of the feature map.Latency estimation. Then, we evaluate the latency of each tile shape in the search space and selectthe optimal tile shape with the lowest latency. The latency includes the data movement latency andthe computation latency: \u2113= \u2113data + \u2113computation.1) Data movement latency \u2113data. The estimation of the latency for data movement requires us tomodel the memory system of a hardware device. We model the memory system of hardware as athree-level architecture [12]: off-chip memory, on-chip global memory, and local memory in PE.The input data and weight data are \ufb01rst transferred from the off-chip memory to the on-chip globalmemory. We assume the hardware can make full use of the off-chip memory bandwidth to simplifythe latency prediction model.After that, the data used to compute the output tiles is transferred from on-chip global memory tothe local m, Your response: ```ADD_PAPER\n2210.06223v1\nThis paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Code is availableat https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.1 IntroductionDynamic neural networks [7] have attracted great research interests in recent years. Compared tostatic models [11, 17, 13, 23] which treat different inputs equally during inference, dynamic networkscan allocate the computation in a data-dependent manner. For example, they can conditionally skipthe computation of network layers [ 15, 9, 32, 30] or convolutional channels [ 19, 1], or performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative image regions ( e.g. the foreground areas)[6, 5, 31, 35, 33, 8]. Spatial-wise dynamic networks, which typically decide whether to computeeach feature pixel with masker modules [5, 31, 35, 8] (Figure 1 (a)), have shown promising results inimproving the inference ef\ufb01ciency of convolution neural networks (CNNs).Despite the remarkable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency achieved by spatial-wise dynamic networks [5, 31, 35],researchers have found it challenging to translate the theoretical results into realistic speedup,\u2217Equal contribution.\u2020Corresponding author.36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2210.06223v1  [cs.CV]  12 Oct 2022--- Page 2 ---Maskergather ...convolution(s) scatter...Dynamic Convolution(s) AlgorithmSchedulingHardwareLatency(a) Algorithm: Spatially adaptive inference with a masker.(b) Scheduling: the practical inference pipeline of dynamic convolutions.(c) The general idea of our work.in\ufb02uence guidanceselected pixel locationsFigure 1: An overview of our method. (a) illustrates the spatially adaptive inference algorithm; (b) isthe scheduling strategy; and (c) presents the three key factors to the practical latency. For a givenhardware, the latency is used to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.especially on some multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs [35, 3, 8]. The challenges are two-fold: 1) mostprevious approaches [5, 31, 35] perform spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest granularity: everypixel is \ufb02exibly decided whether to be computed or not. Such \ufb02exibility induces non-contiguousmemory access [35] and requires specialized scheduling strategies (Figure 1 (b)); 2) the existingliterature has only adopted the hardware-agnostic FLOPs (\ufb02oating-point operations) as an inaccurateproxy for the ef\ufb01ciency, lacking latency-aware guidance on the algorithm design. For dynamicnetworks, the adaptive computation with sub-optimal scheduling strategies further enlarges thediscrepancy between the theoretical FLOPs and the practical latency. Note that it has been validatedby previous works that the latency on CPUs has a strong correlation with FLOPs [8, 35]. Therefore,we mainly focus on the GPU platform in this paper, which is more challenging and less explored.We address the above challenges by proposing a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet). Three key factors to the inference latency are considered: the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties. Given a target hardware device, we directly use the latency,rather than the FLOPs, to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization (Figure 1 (c)).Because the memory access pattern and the scheduling strategies in our dynamic operators differfrom those in static networks, the libraries developed for static models (e.g. cuDNN) are sub-optimalfor the acceleration of dynamic models. Without the support of libraries, each dynamic operatorrequires scheduling optimization, code optimization, compiling, and deployment for each device.Therefore, it is laborious to evaluate the network latency on different hardware platforms. To this end,we propose a novel latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the realistic latency of a networkby simultaneously considering the aforementioned three factors. Compared to the hardware-agnosticFLOPs, our predicted latency can better re\ufb02ect the practical ef\ufb01ciency of dynamic models.Guided by this latency prediction model, we establish our latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet), which adaptively decides whether to allocate computation on feature patches insteadof pixels [5, 31, 35] (Figure 2 top). We name this paradigm as spatially adaptive inference at acoarse granularity. While less \ufb02exible than the pixel-level adaptive computation in previous works[5, 31, 35], it facilitates more contiguous memory access, bene\ufb01ting the realistic speedup on hardware.The scheduling strategy and the implementation are further ameliorated for faster inference.It is worth noting that LASNet is designed as a general framework in two aspects: 1) the coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference paradigm can be conveniently implemented in various CNNbackbones, e.g., ResNets [11], DenseNets [17] and RegNets [25]; and 2) the latency predictor is anoff-the-shell tool which can be directly used for various computing platforms (e.g. server GPUs andedge devices).We evaluate the performance of LASNet on multiple CNN architectures on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Experiment results show that our LASNet improvesthe ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs both theoretically and practically. For example, the inference latencyof ResNet-101 on ImageNet [ 4] is reduced by 36% and 46% on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU andan Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, respectively, without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy. Moreover, the proposedmethod outperforms various lightweight networks in a low-FLOPs regime.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:2--- Page 3 ---1. We propose LASNet, which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference guidedby the practical latency instead of the theoretical FLOPs. To the best of our knowledge,LASNet is the \ufb01rst framework that directly considers the real latency in the design phase ofdynamic neural networks;2. We propose a latency prediction model, which can ef\ufb01ciently and accurately estimate thelatency of dynamic operators by simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties;3. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation and downstream tasks verify that our proposed LAS-Net can effectively improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency of different CNN architectures.2 Related worksSpatial-wise dynamic network is a common type of dynamic neural networks [ 7]. Compared tostatic models which treat different feature locations evenly during inference, these networks performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative regions ( e.g., foregrounds), and reduce theunnecessary computation on less important areas (e.g., backgrounds). Existing works mainly includethree levels of dynamic computation: resolution level [ 36, 37], region level [ 33] and pixel level[5, 31, 35]. The former two generally manipulate the network inputs [ 33, 37] or require specialarchitecture design [36]. In contrast, pixel-level dynamic networks can \ufb02exibly skip the convolutionson certain feature pixels in arbitrary CNN backbones [5, 31, 35]. Despite its remarkable theoreticalef\ufb01ciency, pixel-wise dynamic computation brings considerable dif\ufb01culty to achieving realisticspeedup on multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs. Compared to the previous approaches [ 5, 31, 35]which only focus on reducing the theoretical computation, we propose to directly use the latency toguide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.Hardware-aware network design. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical ef\ufb01ciencyof deep models, researchers have started to consider the real latency in the network design phase.There are two lines of works in this direction. One directly performs speed tests on targeteddevices, and summarizes some guidelines to facilitate hand-designing lightweight models [23]. Theother line of work searches for fast models using the neural architecture search (NAS) technique[29, 34]. However, all existing works try to build static models, which have intrinsic computationalredundancy by treating different inputs in the same way. However, speed tests for dynamic operatorson different hardware devices can be very laborious and impractical. In contrast, our proposed latencyprediction model can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the inference latency on any given computing platforms bysimultaneously considering algorithm design, scheduling strategies and hardware properties.3 MethodologyIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the preliminaries of spatially adaptive inference, and then demon-strate the architecture design of our LASNet. The latency prediction model is then explained, whichguides the granularity settings and the scheduling optimization for LASNet. We further present theimplementation improvements for faster inference, followed by the training strategies.3.1 PreliminariesSpatially adaptive inference. The existing spatial-wise dynamic networks are usually establishedby attaching a masker Min each convolutional block of a CNN backbone (Figure 1 (a)). Speci\ufb01cally,let x\u2208RH\xd7W\xd7C denote the input of a block, where H and W are the feature height and width, andC is the channel number. The masker Mtakes x as input, and generates a binary-valued spatialmask M = M(x) \u2208{0,1}H\xd7W . Each element of M determines whether to perform convolutionoperations on the corresponding location of the output feature. The unselected regions will be \ufb01lledwith the values from the input [5, 31] or obtained via interpolation [35]. We de\ufb01ne the activation rateof a block as r=\u2211i,j Mi,jH\xd7W , representing the ratio of the calculated pixels.Scheduling strategy. During inference, the current scheduling strategy for spatial-wise dynamicconvolutions generally involve three steps [26] (Figure 1 (b)): 1) gathering, which re-organizes theselected pixels (if the convolution kernel size is greater than 1 \xd71, the neighbors are also required)along the batch dimension; 2) computation, which performs convolution on the gathered input; and3) scattering, which \ufb01lls the computed pixels on their corresponding locations of the output feature.3--- Page 4 ---MaskerMasker-Conv1x1 Conv1x1 ...Scatter-Add Conv1x1 Conv3x3 Gumbel NoiseT raining Inference Input OutputUpsample Element-wise  multiplication Selected pixelGather-Conv3x3 Conv1x1 Regular convolution Operator fusionInput OutputFigure 2: Our proposed LASNet block. Top: we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution spatial mask Mcoarse,which is then upsampled to obtain the mask M with the same size as the output feature. GumbelSoftmax [18, 24] is used for end-to-end training (Sec. 3.5). Bottom: the scheduling optimization isperformed to decrease the memory access for faster inference (Sec. 3.4).Limitations. Compared to performing convolutions on the entire feature map, the aforementionedscheduling strategy reduces the computation while bringing considerable overhead to memory accessdue to the mask generation and the non-contiguous memory access. Such overhead would increasethe overall latency, especially when the granularity of dynamic convolution is at the \ufb01nest pixel level.3.2 Architecture designSpatial granularity. As mentioned above, pixel-level dynamic convolutions [5, 31, 35] raise sub-stantial challenges to achieving realistic speedup on multi-core processors due to the non-contiguousmemory access. To this end, we propose to optimize the granularity of spatially adaptive inference.Speci\ufb01cally, take the commonly used bottleneck structure in [11] as an example, our coarse-grainedspatial-wise dynamic convolutional block is illustrated in Figure 2. Instead of directly producinga mask with the shape of H\xd7W, we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution mask Mcoarse \u2208{0,1}HS \xd7WS ,where Sis named as the spatial granularity. Each element in Mcoarse determines the computationof an S\xd7S-sized feature patch. For instance, the feature size in the \ufb01rst ResNet stage3 is 56 \xd756.Then the possible choices for Sare {1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56}.The mask Mcoarse is then upsampledto the size of H\xd7W. Notably, S = 1means that the granularity is still at the pixel level as previousmethods [5, 31, 35]. Note that the other extreme situation (S = 56) is not considered in this paper,when the masker directly determines whether to skip the whole block (i.e. layer skipping [30, 32]).Such an overly aggressive approach will lead to considerable drop of accuracy, as we presented inAppendix C.2. The masker is composed of a pooling layer followed by a 1 \xd71 convolution.Differences to existing works. Without using the interpolation operation [ 35] or the carefullydesigned two-branch structure [8], the proposed block architecture is simple and suf\ufb01ciently generalto be plugged into most backbones with minimal modi\ufb01cation. Our formulation is mostly similar tothat in [31], which could be viewed as a variant of our method with the spatial granularity S=1 for allblocks. Instead of performing spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest pixel level, our granularity Sisoptimized under the guidance of our latency prediction model (details are presented in the followingSec. 4.2) to achieve realistic speedup on target computing platforms.3.3 Latency prediction modelAs stated before, it is laborious to evaluate the latency of dynamic operators on different hardwareplatforms. To ef\ufb01ciently seek preferable granularity settings on arbitrary hardware devices, wepropose a latency prediction model G, which can directly predict the delay of executing dynamicoperators on any target devices. For a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, the latency predictorGtakes the hardware propertiesH, the layer parametersP, the spatial granularityS, and the activationrate ras input and predicts the latency \u2113of a dynamic convolutional block: \u2113= G(H,P,S,r ).Hardware modeling. We model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs), and parallelcomputation can be executed on these PEs. As shown in Figure 3, we model the memory system as a3Here we refer to a stage as the cascading of multiple blocks which process features with the same resolution.4--- Page 5 ---Off-chip Memory(GDDR/DDR/HBM)On-chip Memory(LLC/Global Buffer)PE1PEMemoryComputation UnitsPE2PEMemoryComputation UnitsPEnPEMemoryComputation Units\u2026Figure 3: Our hardware model.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)101520253035Latency ( s)PredictedReal Figure 4: Latency prediction results.three-level structure [12]: 1) off-chip memory, 2) on-chip global memory, and 3) memory in PE. Sucha hardware model enables us to accurately predict the cost on both data movement and computation.Latency prediction. When simulating the data movement procedure, the ef\ufb01ciency of non-contiguous memory accesses under different granularity Ssettings is considered. As for the com-putation latency, it is important to adopt a proper scheduling strategy to increase the parallelism ofcomputation. Therefore, we search for the optimal scheduling (the con\ufb01guration of tiling and in-PEparallel computing) of dynamic operations to maximize the utilization of hardware resources. A moredetailed description of our latency prediction model is presented in Appendix A.Empirical validation. We take the \ufb01rst block in ResNet-101 as an example and vary the activationrate rto evaluate the performance of our prediction model. The comparison between our predictionsand the real testing latency on the Nvidia V100 GPU is illustrated in Figure 4, from which we canobserve that our predictor can accurately estimate the real latency in a wide range of activation rates.3.4 Implementation detailsWe use general optimization methods like fusing activation functions and batch normalizationlayers into convolution layers. We also optimize the speci\ufb01c operators in our spatial-wise dynamicconvolutional blocks as follows (see also Figure 2 for an overview).Fusing the masker and the \ufb01rst convolution. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, the masker in each blockconsumes very little computation, but it takes the whole feature map as input. Therefore, it is amemory-bounded operation (the inference time is mainly spent on memory access). Since the maskerand the \ufb01rst convolution in the block share the same input, there is an opportunity to fuse these twooperations to avoid the repeated access of the input data. Note that a spatial-wise dynamic convolutionrequires the output of the masker. If we fuse the two layers, the \ufb01rst convolution will be changed to astatic operation, which may increase the inference latency. There exists a threshold of activation raterth, when r>r th, the overall latency can be reduced. We decide whether to fuse them according tothe average activation rate. See more details in Appendix B.1.Fusing the gather operation and the dynamic convolution. Traditional approaches \ufb01rst gather theinput pixels of the \ufb01rst dynamic convolution in a block (Figure 1 (b)). The gather operation is alsoa memory-bounded operation. Furthermore, when the size of the convolution kernel exceeds 1\xd71,the area of input patches may overlap, resulting in repeated memory load/store. We fuse the gatheroperation into the dynamic convolution to reduce the memory access.Fusing the scatter operation and the add operation. Traditional approaches scatter the outputpixels of the last dynamic convolution, and then execute the element-wise addition (Figure 1 (b)). Wefuse these two operators to reduce the memory access. The ablation study in Sec. 4.4 validates theeffectiveness of the proposed fusing methods.3.5 TrainingOptimization of non-differentiable maskers. The masker modules are required to produce binary-valued spatial masks for making discrete decisions, and cannot be directly optimized with backpropagation. Following [35, 31, 8], we adopt straight-through Gumbel Softmax [18, 24] to train thenetwork in an end-to-end fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, let \u02dcM \u2208RH\xd7W\xd72 denote the output of the maskgenerator. The decisions are obtained with the argmax function during inference. In the trainingphase, a differentiable approximation is de\ufb01ned by replacing the argmax operation with a Softmax:\u02c6M =exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,0)+ G:,:,0)/\u03c4}\u22111k=0 exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,k)+ G:,:,k)/\u03c4} \u2208 [0,1]H\xd7W , (1)5--- Page 6 ---0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-ResNet blocks on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Latency ratio (r )S = 1(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 5: Latency prediction results of LAS-ResNet blocks on V100 (a) and LAS-RegNet blocks onTX2 (b). For both networks, we plot the relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the activationrate r for the blocks in 4 stages with the convolutional stride 1. The practical ef\ufb01ciency is onlyimproved when r\u2113 <1. Note that S = 1can harm the practical latency even for a small r(reducedcomputation), while a larger Swill alleviate this problem. See detailed analysis in Sec. 4.2.where \u03c4 is the Softmax temperature. Following the common practice [ 31, 8], we let \u03c4 decreaseexponentially from 5.0 to 0.1 in training to facilitate the optimization of maskers.Training objective. The FLOPs of each spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block can be calculatedbased on our de\ufb01ned activation rate r[31]. Then we can obtain the FLOPs of the overall dynamicnetwork Fdyn. Let Fstat denotes the FLOPs of its static counterpart. We optimize their ratio toapproximate a target 0 <t< 1:LFLOPs = (FdynFstat\u2212t)2.In addition, we de\ufb01ne loss item Lbounds asin [31] to constrain the upper bound and the lower bound of activation rates in early training epochs.We further propose to leverage the static counterparts of our dynamic networks as \u201cteachers\u201d to guidethe optimization procedure. Let y and y\u2032denote the output logits of a dynamic model (\u201cstudent\u201d)and its \u201cteacher\u201d, respectively. Our \ufb01nal loss can be written asL= Ltask + \u03b1(LFLOPs + Lbounds) +\u03b2T2 \xb7KL(\u03c3(y/T)||\u03c3(y\u2032/T)), (2)where Ltask represents the task-related loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss in image classi\ufb01cation. KL(\xb7||\xb7)denotes the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, and \u03b1,\u03b2 are the coef\ufb01cients balancing these items. We use\u03c3to denote the log-Softmax function, and T is the temperature for computing KL-divergence.4 ExperimentsIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the experiment settings in Sec. 4.1. Then the latency of differentgranularity settings are analyzed in Sec. 4.2. The performance of our LASNet on ImageNet is furtherevaluated in Sec. 4.3, followed by the ablation studies in Sec. 4.4. Visualization results are illustratedin Sec. 4.5, and we \ufb01nally validate our method on the object detection task (Sec. 4.6). The results onthe instance segmentation task are presented in . For simplicity, we add \u201cLAS-\u201d as a pre\ufb01x beforemodel names to denote our LASNet, e.g., LAS-ResNet-50.4.1 Experiment settingsLatency prediction. Various types of hardware platforms are tested, including a server GPU (TeslaV100), a desktop GPU (GTX1080) and edge devices ( e.g., Nvidia Nano and Jetson TX2). Themajor properties considered by our latency prediction model include the number of processingengines (#PE), the \ufb02oating-point computation in a processing engine (#FP32), the frequency and thebandwidth. It can be observed that the server GPUs generally have a larger #PE than the IoT devices.The batch size is set as 1 for all dynamic models and computing platforms.Image classi\ufb01cation. The image classi\ufb01cation experiments are conducted on the ImageNet [ 4]dataset. Following [31], we initialize the backbone parameter from a pre-trained checkpoint4, and4We use the torchvision pre-trained models at https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.6--- Page 7 ---1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)12345Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.0Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-ResNet blocks on V100.1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 6: The relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the spatial granularity S.\ufb01netune the whole network for 100 epochs with the loss function in Eq. (2). We \ufb01x \u03b1= 10,\u03b2 = 0.5and T = 4.0 for all dynamic models. More details are provided in Appendix B.4.2 Latency prediction resultsIn this subsection, we present the latency prediction results of the spatial-wise dynamic convolutionalblocks in two different models: LAS-ResNet-101 [11] (on V100) and LAS-RegNetY-800MF [25] (onTX2). All the blocks have the bottleneck structure with different channel numbers and convolutiongroups, and the RegNetY is equipped with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [14] modules.We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne \u2113dyn as the latency of a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, and \u2113stat as that ofa static block without a masker. Their ratio is denoted as r\u2113 = \u2113dyn\u2113stat. We investigate the relationshipbetween r\u2113 and the activation rate r(cf. Sec. 3.5) for different granularity settings. The results inFigure 5 demonstrate that: 1) even equipped with our special optimization on the scheduling strategies,pixel-level spatially adaptive inference (S=1) cannot always improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency. Such\ufb01ne-grained adaptive inference is adopted by most previous works [31, 35], and our result can explainthe reason why they can only achieve realistic speedup on less powerful CPUs [35] or specializeddevices [3]; 2) a proper granularity S >1 effectively alleviates this problem on both hardwaredevices. By setting S >1, realistic speedup could be achieved with larger activation rates.The latency prediction results are further used to seek for a preferable granularity setting for the\ufb01rst 3 stages (we \ufb01x S = 1 for the last stage, where the feature resolution is 7 \xd77). Therefore,we plot the relationship between r\u2113 and S in Figure 10. It can be observed that: 1) r\u2113 generallydecreases with Sincreasing for a given r; 2) an overly largeS(less \ufb02exible adaptive inference) bringsinsigni\ufb01cant improvement on both devices. Especially, enlarging S from 8 to 28 in the \ufb01rst stageof a LAS-ResNet brings very little improvement on V100. Based on the results in Figure 10, wecan trade off between \ufb02exibility and ef\ufb01ciency by selecting appropriate Sfor different models andhardware devices. For example, we can simply set Snet=8-4-7-15 in a LAS-ResNet-101 to achiverealistic speedup. The accuracy-latency plots in Figure 7 also validate this observation. More resultsof our latency prediction model on the desktop-level GPU, GTX1080, are presented in Appendix C.1.4.3 ImageNet classi\ufb01cation resultsWe now empirically evaluate our proposed LASNet on the ImageNet dataset. The network perfor-mance is measured in terms of the trade-off between classi\ufb01cation accuracy and inference ef\ufb01ciency.Both theoretical (i.e. FLOPs) and practical ef\ufb01ciency (i.e. latency) are tested in our experiments.5We use this form to represnet the Ssettings for the 4 stages of a network.7--- Page 8 ---2 3 4 5 6 7 8FLOPs (x1e9)73747576777879Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101SkipNet-ResNet-101BAS-ResNet-50DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)15 20 25 30 35 40Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)(a) LAS-ResNet results.0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8FLOPs (x1e9)717273747576Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2ShuffleNets-v2CondenseNetsLAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)3 4 5 6 7 8Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)8 10 12 14 16 18 20Latency on Nvidia nano GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-YRegNets-XMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)(b) LAS-RegNetY results.Figure 7: Experimental results on ImageNet. The proposed coarse-grained spatially adaptive inferenceis tested on standard ResNets (a) and lightweight RegNets (b).4.3.1 Standard baseline comparison: ResNetsWe \ufb01rst establish our LASNet based on the standard ResNets [ 11]. Speci\ufb01cally, we build LAS-ResNet-50 and LAS-ResNet-101 by plugging our maskers in the two common ResNet structures.The baselines include various types of dynamic inference approaches: 1) layer skipping (SkipNet[32] and Conv-AIG [30]); 2) channel skipping (BAS [1]); and 3) pixel-level spatial-wise dynamicnetwork (DynConv [31]). For our LASNet, we compare various settings of the spatial granularitySnet. We set training targets (cf. Sec. 3.5) t\u2208{0,4,0.5,0.6,0.7}for our dynamic models to evaluatetheir performance in different sparsity regimes. We apply the same operator fusion (Sec. 3.4) for bothour models and the compared baselines [30, 31] for fair comparison.Results are presented in Figure 7 (a). On the left we plot the relationship of accuracy v.s. FLOPs. Itcan be observed that our LAS-ResNets with different granularity settings signi\ufb01cantly outperformthe competing dynamic neural networks. Surprisingly, coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1 for the 4 stages) can achieve even higher accuracy when consumingsimilar FLOPs on ResNets, despite the sacri\ufb01ced \ufb02exibility compared toSnet=1-1-1-1. We conjecturethat a larger Sis also bene\ufb01cial to the optimization of maskers.We compare the practical latency of three granularity settings in Figure 7 (a) predicted by our latencyprediction model (middle on TX2 and right on V100). We can witness that although they achievecomparable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency (Figure 7 (a) left), larger Sis more hardware-friendly comparedto the \ufb01nest granularity. For example, the inference latency of LAS-ResNet-101 ( Snet=1-1-1-1)is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the ResNet-101 baseline on V100 (Figure 7 (a) right), even though itstheoretical computation is much smaller than that of the static model. However, larger granularities(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1) can effectively improve the inference latency due to its lower burdenon the memory access. Remarkably, the latency of ResNet-101 could be reduced by 36% and 46% onV100 and TX2 respectively without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy when t=0.4. The classi\ufb01cation accuracyis increased by 1.9% with similar inference ef\ufb01ciency. It can be observed that the realistic speedupratio r\u2113 is more close to the theoretical FLOPs ratio target ton the less powerful TX2, because thelatency is computation-bounded (i.e. the latency is mainly spent on computation) on such IoT devices.In contrast, there is a larger gap between practical and theoretical ef\ufb01ciency on the more powerfulV100, as the latency is bounded by the memory access cost.4.3.2 Lightweight baseline comparison: RegNetsWe further evaluate our LASNet in lightweight CNN architectures,i.e. RegNets-Y [25]. Two differentsized models are tested: RegNetY-400MF and RegNetY-800MF. Compared baselines include othertypes of ef\ufb01cient models, e.g., MobileNets-v2 [28], Shuf\ufb02etNets-v2 [23] and CondenseNets [16].The results are presented in Figure 7 (b). The x-axis for the three sub-\ufb01gures are the FLOPs, thelatency on TX2, and the latency on the Nvidia nano GPU, respectively. We can observe that our8--- Page 9 ---1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%) static ResNetsLAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)Figure 8: Ablation studies on S.

More results on image classi\ufb01cation are provided in Appendix C.2.4.4 Ablation studiesWe conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our coarse-grained spatially adaptiveinference (Sec. 3.2) and operator fusion operations (Sec. 3.4).More granularities settings. We test various granularity settings on LAS-ResNet-101 to examinethe effects of Sin different stages. The results on the Tesla-V100 GPU are presented in Figure 8. Itcan be found that the \ufb01nest granularity (Snet=1-1-1-1) leads to substantial inef\ufb01ciency despite thereduced FLOPs (cf. Figure 7 (a) left). Coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference in the \ufb01rst twostages (Snet=4-4-1-1) effectively reduces the inference latency. We further increase Sin the thirdstage to 2 and 7, and this procedure consistently improves the realistic ef\ufb01ciency on the V100 GPU.This trend also holds on the GTX 1080 GPU (see the results in Appendix C.2.Table 1: Ablation studies on operator fusion.Masker- Gather- Scatter- LatencyConv1x1 Conv3x3 Add (\xb5s)   163.2   90.1   86.7   71.4Operator fusion. We investigate the effect of ouroperator fusion introduced in Sec. 3.4. One convolu-tional block in the \ufb01rst stage of a LAS-ResNet-101(S=4, r=0.6) is tested. The results in Table 1 vali-date that every step of operator fusion bene\ufb01ts thepractical latency of a block, as the overhead onmemory access is effectively reduced. Especially,the fusion of the masker operation and the \ufb01rst con-volution is crucial to reducing the latency.4.5 VisualizationWe visualize the masks generated by our masker in the third block of a LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1) in Figure 12. The brilliant areas correspond to the locations of 1 elements in a mask, andthe computation on the dimmed regions is skipped by our dynamic model. We can witness that themasker accurately locate the most task-related regions (even the tiny aircraft at the corner), whichhelps reduce the unnecessary computation on background areas. These resultsalso suggest that forthe \ufb01rst stage, the granularity S=4 is suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02exible to recognize the important regions, anda win-win can be achieved between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. Interestingly, the masker could selectsome objects that are not labeled for the sample, e.g., the \ufb02ower beside the hummingbird and thehuman holding the camera. This indicates that our spatial-wise dynamic networks can automaticallyrecognize the regions with semantics, and their capability is not limited by the classi\ufb01cation labels.This property is helpful in some downstream tasks, such as object detection (Sec. 4.6) and instancesegmentation (Sec. 4.7), which require detecting multiple classes and objects in an image. Morevisualization results could be found in Appendix C.3.4.6 COCO Object detectionWe further evaluate our LASNet on the COCO [22] object detection task. The mean average precision(mAP), the average backbone FLOPs, and the average backbone latency on the validation set areused to measure the network performance. We test two commonly used detection frameworks: FasterR-CNN [27] with Feature Pyramid Network [20] and RetinaNet [21]. Thanks to the generality ofour method, we can conveniently replace the backbones with ours pre-trained on ImageNet, andthe whole models are \ufb01netuned on COCO with the standard setting for 12 epochs (see detailed9--- Page 10 ---Table 2: Object detection results on the COCO dataset.Detection Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)mAP (%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Faster R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 39.4LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.6) 90.7 33.8 90.6 524.9 40.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 79.3 30.7 82.5 477.1 39.8LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.5 29.0 79.9 464.8 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 67.9 25.3 69.1 401.3 39.5RetinaNetResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 38.5LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 77.8 30.4 81.8 472.6 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.4 28.9 79.9 464.8 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 66.4 25.3 69.1 401.3 38.9Table 3: Instance Segmentation results on the COCO dataset.Segmentation Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)APmask(%) APbox(%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Mask R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 80.5 31.1 83.3 481.9 37.0 41.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.4) 69.2 27.9 74.8 431.6 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 68.8 25.8 70.9 411.8 36.2 40.0setup in Appendix B.3).

We can observe from the results that when setting the training target as 0.4, the latency ofour LAS-ResNet-101 with Snet=4-4-7-1 is signi\ufb01cantly lower than the static baseline on all deviceswithout sacri\ufb01cing mAP in both detection frameworks. With a larger training targets, our LASNetcan increase the mAP by 0.9% and 0.8% in Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet respectively, while stillbeing faster than the baseline method.4.7 COCO instance segmentationWe also present the results of instance segmentation on COCO, which demonstrate the effectivenessof our LASNet on the dense prediction task. From the results in Table 3, we can observe that whensetting the training target as 0.4, the Mask R-CNN [ 10] models (Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=4-4-7-1)runs faster on all tested hardware devices without sacri\ufb01cing the performance. With a training targetof 0.5, the APmask and APbox of the Mask R-CNN model could be increased by 0.9% and 1.0%respectively while still running faster than the baseline method.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we propose to build latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic networks (LASNet) under theguidance of a latency prediction model. By simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy and the hardware properties, we can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the practical latency of spatial-wise dynamic operators on arbitrary computing platforms. Based on the empirical analysis on therelationship between the latency and the granularity of spatially adaptive inference, we optimizeboth the algorithm and the scheduling strategies to achieve realistic speedup on many multi-coreprocessors, e.g., the Tesla V100 GPU and the Jetson TX2 GPU. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection and instance segmentation tasks validate that the proposed method signi\ufb01cantlyimproves the practical ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs, and outperforms various competing approaches.AcknowledgementThis work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant2020AAA0105200, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62022048and the Tsinghua University-China Mobile Communications Group Co.,Ltd.

NeurIPS, 2021.12--- Page 13 ---AppendixA Latency prediction model.As the dynamic operators in our method have not been supported by current deep learning libraries,we propose a latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the real latency of these operators onhardware device. The inputs of the latency prediction model include: 1) the structural con\ufb01gurationof a convolutional block, 2) its activation rate rwhich decides the computation amount, 3) the spatialgranularity S, and 4) the hardware properties mentioned in Table 4. The latency of a dynamic blockis predicted as follows.Input/output shape de\ufb01nition. The \ufb01rst step of predicting the latency of an operation is to calculatethe shape of input and output. Taking the gather-conv2 operation as an example, the input of thisoperation is the activation with the shape of Cin \xd7H \xd7W, where Cin is the number of inputchannels, and H and W are the resolution of the feature map. The shape of the output tensor isP \xd7Cout \xd7S\xd7S, where P is the number of output patches, Cout is the number of output channelsand Sis the spatial granularity. Note that P is obtained based on the output of our maskers.Operation-to-hardware mapping. Next, we map the operations to hardware. As is mentioned in thepaper, we model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs). We assign the computationof each element in the output feature map to a PE. Speci\ufb01cally, we consecutively split the outputfeature map into multiple tiles. The shape of each tile is TP \xd7TC \xd7TS1 \xd7TS2. These split tilesare assigned to multiple PEs. The computation of the elements in each tile is executed in a PE. Wecan con\ufb01gure different shapes of tiles. In order to determine the optimal shape of the tile, we makea search space of different tile shapes. The tile shape has 4 dimensions. The candidates of eachdimension are power-of-2 and do not exceed the corresponding dimension of the feature map.Latency estimation. Then, we evaluate the latency of each tile shape in the search space and selectthe optimal tile shape with the lowest latency. The latency includes the data movement latency andthe computation latency: \u2113= \u2113data + \u2113computation.1) Data movement latency \u2113data. The estimation of the latency for data movement requires us tomodel the memory system of a hardware device. We model the memory system of hardware as athree-level architecture [12]: off-chip memory, on-chip global memory, and local memory in PE.The input data and weight data are \ufb01rst transferred from the off-chip memory to the on-chip globalmemory. We assume the hardware can make full use of the off-chip memory bandwidth to simplifythe latency prediction model.After that, the data used to compute the output tiles is transferred from on-chip global memory tothe local m, Your response: ```ADD_PAPER\n2210.06223v1\nThis paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance.

For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k.

To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Code is availableat https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.1 IntroductionDynamic neural networks [7] have attracted great research interests in recent years. Compared tostatic models [11, 17, 13, 23] which treat different inputs equally during inference, dynamic networkscan allocate the computation in a data-dependent manner. For example, they can conditionally skipthe computation of network layers [ 15, 9, 32, 30] or convolutional channels [ 19, 1], or performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative image regions ( e.g. the foreground areas)[6, 5, 31, 35, 33, 8]. Spatial-wise dynamic networks, which typically decide whether to computeeach feature pixel with masker modules [5, 31, 35, 8] (Figure 1 (a)), have shown promising results inimproving the inference ef\ufb01ciency of convolution neural networks (CNNs).Despite the remarkable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency achieved by spatial-wise dynamic networks [5, 31, 35],researchers have found it challenging to translate the theoretical results into realistic speedup,\u2217Equal contribution.\u2020Corresponding author.36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).arXiv:2210.06223v1  [cs.CV]  12 Oct 2022--- Page 2 ---Maskergather ...convolution(s) scatter...Dynamic Convolution(s) AlgorithmSchedulingHardwareLatency(a) Algorithm: Spatially adaptive inference with a masker.(b) Scheduling: the practical inference pipeline of dynamic convolutions.(c) The general idea of our work.in\ufb02uence guidanceselected pixel locationsFigure 1: An overview of our method. (a) illustrates the spatially adaptive inference algorithm; (b) isthe scheduling strategy; and (c) presents the three key factors to the practical latency. For a givenhardware, the latency is used to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.especially on some multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs [35, 3, 8]. The challenges are two-fold: 1) mostprevious approaches [5, 31, 35] perform spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest granularity: everypixel is \ufb02exibly decided whether to be computed or not. Such \ufb02exibility induces non-contiguousmemory access [35] and requires specialized scheduling strategies (Figure 1 (b)); 2) the existingliterature has only adopted the hardware-agnostic FLOPs (\ufb02oating-point operations) as an inaccurateproxy for the ef\ufb01ciency, lacking latency-aware guidance on the algorithm design. For dynamicnetworks, the adaptive computation with sub-optimal scheduling strategies further enlarges thediscrepancy between the theoretical FLOPs and the practical latency. Note that it has been validatedby previous works that the latency on CPUs has a strong correlation with FLOPs [8, 35]. Therefore,we mainly focus on the GPU platform in this paper, which is more challenging and less explored.We address the above challenges by proposing a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet). Three key factors to the inference latency are considered: the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties. Given a target hardware device, we directly use the latency,rather than the FLOPs, to guide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization (Figure 1 (c)).Because the memory access pattern and the scheduling strategies in our dynamic operators differfrom those in static networks, the libraries developed for static models (e.g. cuDNN) are sub-optimalfor the acceleration of dynamic models. Without the support of libraries, each dynamic operatorrequires scheduling optimization, code optimization, compiling, and deployment for each device.Therefore, it is laborious to evaluate the network latency on different hardware platforms. To this end,we propose a novel latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the realistic latency of a networkby simultaneously considering the aforementioned three factors. Compared to the hardware-agnosticFLOPs, our predicted latency can better re\ufb02ect the practical ef\ufb01ciency of dynamic models.Guided by this latency prediction model, we establish our latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network(LASNet), which adaptively decides whether to allocate computation on feature patches insteadof pixels [5, 31, 35] (Figure 2 top). We name this paradigm as spatially adaptive inference at acoarse granularity. While less \ufb02exible than the pixel-level adaptive computation in previous works[5, 31, 35], it facilitates more contiguous memory access, bene\ufb01ting the realistic speedup on hardware.The scheduling strategy and the implementation are further ameliorated for faster inference.It is worth noting that LASNet is designed as a general framework in two aspects: 1) the coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference paradigm can be conveniently implemented in various CNNbackbones, e.g., ResNets [11], DenseNets [17] and RegNets [25]; and 2) the latency predictor is anoff-the-shell tool which can be directly used for various computing platforms (e.g. server GPUs andedge devices).We evaluate the performance of LASNet on multiple CNN architectures on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Experiment results show that our LASNet improvesthe ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs both theoretically and practically. For example, the inference latencyof ResNet-101 on ImageNet [ 4] is reduced by 36% and 46% on an Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU andan Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU, respectively, without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy. Moreover, the proposedmethod outperforms various lightweight networks in a low-FLOPs regime.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:2--- Page 3 ---1. We propose LASNet, which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference guidedby the practical latency instead of the theoretical FLOPs. To the best of our knowledge,LASNet is the \ufb01rst framework that directly considers the real latency in the design phase ofdynamic neural networks;2. We propose a latency prediction model, which can ef\ufb01ciently and accurately estimate thelatency of dynamic operators by simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy, and the hardware properties;3. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation and downstream tasks verify that our proposed LAS-Net can effectively improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency of different CNN architectures.2 Related worksSpatial-wise dynamic network is a common type of dynamic neural networks [ 7]. Compared tostatic models which treat different feature locations evenly during inference, these networks performspatially adaptive inference on the most informative regions ( e.g., foregrounds), and reduce theunnecessary computation on less important areas (e.g., backgrounds). Existing works mainly includethree levels of dynamic computation: resolution level [ 36, 37], region level [ 33] and pixel level[5, 31, 35]. The former two generally manipulate the network inputs [ 33, 37] or require specialarchitecture design [36]. In contrast, pixel-level dynamic networks can \ufb02exibly skip the convolutionson certain feature pixels in arbitrary CNN backbones [5, 31, 35]. Despite its remarkable theoreticalef\ufb01ciency, pixel-wise dynamic computation brings considerable dif\ufb01culty to achieving realisticspeedup on multi-core processors, e.g., GPUs. Compared to the previous approaches [ 5, 31, 35]which only focus on reducing the theoretical computation, we propose to directly use the latency toguide our algorithm design and scheduling optimization.Hardware-aware network design. To bridge the gap between theoretical and practical ef\ufb01ciencyof deep models, researchers have started to consider the real latency in the network design phase.There are two lines of works in this direction. One directly performs speed tests on targeteddevices, and summarizes some guidelines to facilitate hand-designing lightweight models [23]. Theother line of work searches for fast models using the neural architecture search (NAS) technique[29, 34]. However, all existing works try to build static models, which have intrinsic computationalredundancy by treating different inputs in the same way. However, speed tests for dynamic operatorson different hardware devices can be very laborious and impractical. In contrast, our proposed latencyprediction model can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the inference latency on any given computing platforms bysimultaneously considering algorithm design, scheduling strategies and hardware properties.3 MethodologyIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the preliminaries of spatially adaptive inference, and then demon-strate the architecture design of our LASNet. The latency prediction model is then explained, whichguides the granularity settings and the scheduling optimization for LASNet. We further present theimplementation improvements for faster inference, followed by the training strategies.3.1 PreliminariesSpatially adaptive inference. The existing spatial-wise dynamic networks are usually establishedby attaching a masker Min each convolutional block of a CNN backbone (Figure 1 (a)). Speci\ufb01cally,let x\u2208RH\xd7W\xd7C denote the input of a block, where H and W are the feature height and width, andC is the channel number. The masker Mtakes x as input, and generates a binary-valued spatialmask M = M(x) \u2208{0,1}H\xd7W . Each element of M determines whether to perform convolutionoperations on the corresponding location of the output feature. The unselected regions will be \ufb01lledwith the values from the input [5, 31] or obtained via interpolation [35]. We de\ufb01ne the activation rateof a block as r=\u2211i,j Mi,jH\xd7W , representing the ratio of the calculated pixels.Scheduling strategy. During inference, the current scheduling strategy for spatial-wise dynamicconvolutions generally involve three steps [26] (Figure 1 (b)): 1) gathering, which re-organizes theselected pixels (if the convolution kernel size is greater than 1 \xd71, the neighbors are also required)along the batch dimension; 2) computation, which performs convolution on the gathered input; and3) scattering, which \ufb01lls the computed pixels on their corresponding locations of the output feature.3--- Page 4 ---MaskerMasker-Conv1x1 Conv1x1 ...Scatter-Add Conv1x1 Conv3x3 Gumbel NoiseT raining Inference Input OutputUpsample Element-wise  multiplication Selected pixelGather-Conv3x3 Conv1x1 Regular convolution Operator fusionInput OutputFigure 2: Our proposed LASNet block. Top: we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution spatial mask Mcoarse,which is then upsampled to obtain the mask M with the same size as the output feature. GumbelSoftmax [18, 24] is used for end-to-end training (Sec. 3.5). Bottom: the scheduling optimization isperformed to decrease the memory access for faster inference (Sec. 3.4).Limitations. Compared to performing convolutions on the entire feature map, the aforementionedscheduling strategy reduces the computation while bringing considerable overhead to memory accessdue to the mask generation and the non-contiguous memory access. Such overhead would increasethe overall latency, especially when the granularity of dynamic convolution is at the \ufb01nest pixel level.3.2 Architecture designSpatial granularity. As mentioned above, pixel-level dynamic convolutions [5, 31, 35] raise sub-stantial challenges to achieving realistic speedup on multi-core processors due to the non-contiguousmemory access. To this end, we propose to optimize the granularity of spatially adaptive inference.Speci\ufb01cally, take the commonly used bottleneck structure in [11] as an example, our coarse-grainedspatial-wise dynamic convolutional block is illustrated in Figure 2. Instead of directly producinga mask with the shape of H\xd7W, we \ufb01rst generate a low-resolution mask Mcoarse \u2208{0,1}HS \xd7WS ,where Sis named as the spatial granularity. Each element in Mcoarse determines the computationof an S\xd7S-sized feature patch. For instance, the feature size in the \ufb01rst ResNet stage3 is 56 \xd756.Then the possible choices for Sare {1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56}.The mask Mcoarse is then upsampledto the size of H\xd7W. Notably, S = 1means that the granularity is still at the pixel level as previousmethods [5, 31, 35]. Note that the other extreme situation (S = 56) is not considered in this paper,when the masker directly determines whether to skip the whole block (i.e. layer skipping [30, 32]).Such an overly aggressive approach will lead to considerable drop of accuracy, as we presented inAppendix C.2. The masker is composed of a pooling layer followed by a 1 \xd71 convolution.Differences to existing works. Without using the interpolation operation [ 35] or the carefullydesigned two-branch structure [8], the proposed block architecture is simple and suf\ufb01ciently generalto be plugged into most backbones with minimal modi\ufb01cation. Our formulation is mostly similar tothat in [31], which could be viewed as a variant of our method with the spatial granularity S=1 for allblocks. Instead of performing spatially adaptive inference at the \ufb01nest pixel level, our granularity Sisoptimized under the guidance of our latency prediction model (details are presented in the followingSec. 4.2) to achieve realistic speedup on target computing platforms.3.3 Latency prediction modelAs stated before, it is laborious to evaluate the latency of dynamic operators on different hardwareplatforms. To ef\ufb01ciently seek preferable granularity settings on arbitrary hardware devices, wepropose a latency prediction model G, which can directly predict the delay of executing dynamicoperators on any target devices. For a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, the latency predictorGtakes the hardware propertiesH, the layer parametersP, the spatial granularityS, and the activationrate ras input and predicts the latency \u2113of a dynamic convolutional block: \u2113= G(H,P,S,r ).Hardware modeling. We model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs), and parallelcomputation can be executed on these PEs. As shown in Figure 3, we model the memory system as a3Here we refer to a stage as the cascading of multiple blocks which process features with the same resolution.4--- Page 5 ---Off-chip Memory(GDDR/DDR/HBM)On-chip Memory(LLC/Global Buffer)PE1PEMemoryComputation UnitsPE2PEMemoryComputation UnitsPEnPEMemoryComputation Units\u2026Figure 3: Our hardware model.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)101520253035Latency ( s)PredictedReal Figure 4: Latency prediction results.three-level structure [12]: 1) off-chip memory, 2) on-chip global memory, and 3) memory in PE. Sucha hardware model enables us to accurately predict the cost on both data movement and computation.Latency prediction. When simulating the data movement procedure, the ef\ufb01ciency of non-contiguous memory accesses under different granularity Ssettings is considered. As for the com-putation latency, it is important to adopt a proper scheduling strategy to increase the parallelism ofcomputation. Therefore, we search for the optimal scheduling (the con\ufb01guration of tiling and in-PEparallel computing) of dynamic operations to maximize the utilization of hardware resources. A moredetailed description of our latency prediction model is presented in Appendix A.Empirical validation. We take the \ufb01rst block in ResNet-101 as an example and vary the activationrate rto evaluate the performance of our prediction model. The comparison between our predictionsand the real testing latency on the Nvidia V100 GPU is illustrated in Figure 4, from which we canobserve that our predictor can accurately estimate the real latency in a wide range of activation rates.3.4 Implementation detailsWe use general optimization methods like fusing activation functions and batch normalizationlayers into convolution layers. We also optimize the speci\ufb01c operators in our spatial-wise dynamicconvolutional blocks as follows (see also Figure 2 for an overview).Fusing the masker and the \ufb01rst convolution. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1, the masker in each blockconsumes very little computation, but it takes the whole feature map as input. Therefore, it is amemory-bounded operation (the inference time is mainly spent on memory access). Since the maskerand the \ufb01rst convolution in the block share the same input, there is an opportunity to fuse these twooperations to avoid the repeated access of the input data. Note that a spatial-wise dynamic convolutionrequires the output of the masker. If we fuse the two layers, the \ufb01rst convolution will be changed to astatic operation, which may increase the inference latency. There exists a threshold of activation raterth, when r>r th, the overall latency can be reduced. We decide whether to fuse them according tothe average activation rate. See more details in Appendix B.1.Fusing the gather operation and the dynamic convolution. Traditional approaches \ufb01rst gather theinput pixels of the \ufb01rst dynamic convolution in a block (Figure 1 (b)). The gather operation is alsoa memory-bounded operation. Furthermore, when the size of the convolution kernel exceeds 1\xd71,the area of input patches may overlap, resulting in repeated memory load/store. We fuse the gatheroperation into the dynamic convolution to reduce the memory access.Fusing the scatter operation and the add operation. Traditional approaches scatter the outputpixels of the last dynamic convolution, and then execute the element-wise addition (Figure 1 (b)). Wefuse these two operators to reduce the memory access. The ablation study in Sec. 4.4 validates theeffectiveness of the proposed fusing methods.3.5 TrainingOptimization of non-differentiable maskers. The masker modules are required to produce binary-valued spatial masks for making discrete decisions, and cannot be directly optimized with backpropagation. Following [35, 31, 8], we adopt straight-through Gumbel Softmax [18, 24] to train thenetwork in an end-to-end fashion. Speci\ufb01cally, let \u02dcM \u2208RH\xd7W\xd72 denote the output of the maskgenerator. The decisions are obtained with the argmax function during inference. In the trainingphase, a differentiable approximation is de\ufb01ned by replacing the argmax operation with a Softmax:\u02c6M =exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,0)+ G:,:,0)/\u03c4}\u22111k=0 exp{(log(\u02dcM:,:,k)+ G:,:,k)/\u03c4} \u2208 [0,1]H\xd7W , (1)5--- Page 6 ---0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-ResNet blocks on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU.0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 8S = 14S = 280.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 4S = 7S = 140.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )S = 1S = 2S = 70.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Activation rate (r)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4Latency ratio (r )S = 1(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and rfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on the Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 5: Latency prediction results of LAS-ResNet blocks on V100 (a) and LAS-RegNet blocks onTX2 (b). For both networks, we plot the relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the activationrate r for the blocks in 4 stages with the convolutional stride 1. The practical ef\ufb01ciency is onlyimproved when r\u2113 <1. Note that S = 1can harm the practical latency even for a small r(reducedcomputation), while a larger Swill alleviate this problem. See detailed analysis in Sec. 4.2.where \u03c4 is the Softmax temperature. Following the common practice [ 31, 8], we let \u03c4 decreaseexponentially from 5.0 to 0.1 in training to facilitate the optimization of maskers.Training objective. The FLOPs of each spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block can be calculatedbased on our de\ufb01ned activation rate r[31]. Then we can obtain the FLOPs of the overall dynamicnetwork Fdyn. Let Fstat denotes the FLOPs of its static counterpart. We optimize their ratio toapproximate a target 0 <t< 1:LFLOPs = (FdynFstat\u2212t)2.In addition, we de\ufb01ne loss item Lbounds asin [31] to constrain the upper bound and the lower bound of activation rates in early training epochs.We further propose to leverage the static counterparts of our dynamic networks as \u201cteachers\u201d to guidethe optimization procedure. Let y and y\u2032denote the output logits of a dynamic model (\u201cstudent\u201d)and its \u201cteacher\u201d, respectively. Our \ufb01nal loss can be written asL= Ltask + \u03b1(LFLOPs + Lbounds) +\u03b2T2 \xb7KL(\u03c3(y/T)||\u03c3(y\u2032/T)), (2)where Ltask represents the task-related loss, e.g., cross-entropy loss in image classi\ufb01cation. KL(\xb7||\xb7)denotes the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, and \u03b1,\u03b2 are the coef\ufb01cients balancing these items. We use\u03c3to denote the log-Softmax function, and T is the temperature for computing KL-divergence.4 ExperimentsIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the experiment settings in Sec. 4.1. Then the latency of differentgranularity settings are analyzed in Sec. 4.2. The performance of our LASNet on ImageNet is furtherevaluated in Sec. 4.3, followed by the ablation studies in Sec. 4.4. Visualization results are illustratedin Sec. 4.5, and we \ufb01nally validate our method on the object detection task (Sec. 4.6). The results onthe instance segmentation task are presented in . For simplicity, we add \u201cLAS-\u201d as a pre\ufb01x beforemodel names to denote our LASNet, e.g., LAS-ResNet-50.4.1 Experiment settingsLatency prediction. Various types of hardware platforms are tested, including a server GPU (TeslaV100), a desktop GPU (GTX1080) and edge devices ( e.g., Nvidia Nano and Jetson TX2). Themajor properties considered by our latency prediction model include the number of processingengines (#PE), the \ufb02oating-point computation in a processing engine (#FP32), the frequency and thebandwidth. It can be observed that the server GPUs generally have a larger #PE than the IoT devices.The batch size is set as 1 for all dynamic models and computing platforms.Image classi\ufb01cation. The image classi\ufb01cation experiments are conducted on the ImageNet [ 4]dataset. Following [31], we initialize the backbone parameter from a pre-trained checkpoint4, and4We use the torchvision pre-trained models at https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.6--- Page 7 ---1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)12345Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.51.01.52.02.53.0Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(a) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-ResNet blocks on V100.1 2 4 7 8 14 28Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.75Latency ratio (r )stage 1r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 4 7 14Spatial granularity (S)0.250.500.751.001.251.501.752.00Latency ratio (r )stage 2r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.001 2 7Spatial granularity (S)0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6Latency ratio (r )stage 3r = 0.00r = 0.25r = 0.50r = 0.75r = 1.00(b) Relationship between r\u2113 and Sfor LAS-RegNetY-800MF blocks on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU.Figure 6: The relationship between the latency ratio r\u2113 and the spatial granularity S.\ufb01netune the whole network for 100 epochs with the loss function in Eq. (2). We \ufb01x \u03b1= 10,\u03b2 = 0.5and T = 4.0 for all dynamic models. More details are provided in Appendix B.4.2 Latency prediction resultsIn this subsection, we present the latency prediction results of the spatial-wise dynamic convolutionalblocks in two different models: LAS-ResNet-101 [11] (on V100) and LAS-RegNetY-800MF [25] (onTX2). All the blocks have the bottleneck structure with different channel numbers and convolutiongroups, and the RegNetY is equipped with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) [14] modules.We \ufb01rst de\ufb01ne \u2113dyn as the latency of a spatial-wise dynamic convolutional block, and \u2113stat as that ofa static block without a masker. Their ratio is denoted as r\u2113 = \u2113dyn\u2113stat. We investigate the relationshipbetween r\u2113 and the activation rate r(cf. Sec. 3.5) for different granularity settings. The results inFigure 5 demonstrate that: 1) even equipped with our special optimization on the scheduling strategies,pixel-level spatially adaptive inference (S=1) cannot always improve the practical ef\ufb01ciency. Such\ufb01ne-grained adaptive inference is adopted by most previous works [31, 35], and our result can explainthe reason why they can only achieve realistic speedup on less powerful CPUs [35] or specializeddevices [3]; 2) a proper granularity S >1 effectively alleviates this problem on both hardwaredevices. By setting S >1, realistic speedup could be achieved with larger activation rates.The latency prediction results are further used to seek for a preferable granularity setting for the\ufb01rst 3 stages (we \ufb01x S = 1 for the last stage, where the feature resolution is 7 \xd77). Therefore,we plot the relationship between r\u2113 and S in Figure 10. It can be observed that: 1) r\u2113 generallydecreases with Sincreasing for a given r; 2) an overly largeS(less \ufb02exible adaptive inference) bringsinsigni\ufb01cant improvement on both devices. Especially, enlarging S from 8 to 28 in the \ufb01rst stageof a LAS-ResNet brings very little improvement on V100. Based on the results in Figure 10, wecan trade off between \ufb02exibility and ef\ufb01ciency by selecting appropriate Sfor different models andhardware devices. For example, we can simply set Snet=8-4-7-15 in a LAS-ResNet-101 to achiverealistic speedup. The accuracy-latency plots in Figure 7 also validate this observation. More resultsof our latency prediction model on the desktop-level GPU, GTX1080, are presented in Appendix C.1.4.3 ImageNet classi\ufb01cation resultsWe now empirically evaluate our proposed LASNet on the ImageNet dataset. The network perfor-mance is measured in terms of the trade-off between classi\ufb01cation accuracy and inference ef\ufb01ciency.Both theoretical (i.e. FLOPs) and practical ef\ufb01ciency (i.e. latency) are tested in our experiments.5We use this form to represnet the Ssettings for the 4 stages of a network.7--- Page 8 ---2 3 4 5 6 7 8FLOPs (x1e9)73747576777879Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101SkipNet-ResNet-101BAS-ResNet-50DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)15 20 25 30 35 40Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.076.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%)static ResNetsConvAIG-ResNet-101DynConv-ResNet-101LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-50 (Snet=8-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)(a) LAS-ResNet results.0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8FLOPs (x1e9)717273747576Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2ShuffleNets-v2CondenseNetsLAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-400MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)3 4 5 6 7 8Latency on Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-XRegNets-YMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)8 10 12 14 16 18 20Latency on Nvidia nano GPU (ms)72.573.073.574.074.575.075.576.076.5Accuracy (%)RegNets-YRegNets-XMobileNets-v2LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-RegNetY-800MF (Snet=4-4-7-1)(b) LAS-RegNetY results.Figure 7: Experimental results on ImageNet. The proposed coarse-grained spatially adaptive inferenceis tested on standard ResNets (a) and lightweight RegNets (b).4.3.1 Standard baseline comparison: ResNetsWe \ufb01rst establish our LASNet based on the standard ResNets [ 11]. Speci\ufb01cally, we build LAS-ResNet-50 and LAS-ResNet-101 by plugging our maskers in the two common ResNet structures.The baselines include various types of dynamic inference approaches: 1) layer skipping (SkipNet[32] and Conv-AIG [30]); 2) channel skipping (BAS [1]); and 3) pixel-level spatial-wise dynamicnetwork (DynConv [31]). For our LASNet, we compare various settings of the spatial granularitySnet. We set training targets (cf. Sec. 3.5) t\u2208{0,4,0.5,0.6,0.7}for our dynamic models to evaluatetheir performance in different sparsity regimes. We apply the same operator fusion (Sec. 3.4) for bothour models and the compared baselines [30, 31] for fair comparison.Results are presented in Figure 7 (a). On the left we plot the relationship of accuracy v.s. FLOPs. Itcan be observed that our LAS-ResNets with different granularity settings signi\ufb01cantly outperformthe competing dynamic neural networks. Surprisingly, coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1 for the 4 stages) can achieve even higher accuracy when consumingsimilar FLOPs on ResNets, despite the sacri\ufb01ced \ufb02exibility compared toSnet=1-1-1-1. We conjecturethat a larger Sis also bene\ufb01cial to the optimization of maskers.We compare the practical latency of three granularity settings in Figure 7 (a) predicted by our latencyprediction model (middle on TX2 and right on V100). We can witness that although they achievecomparable theoretical ef\ufb01ciency (Figure 7 (a) left), larger Sis more hardware-friendly comparedto the \ufb01nest granularity. For example, the inference latency of LAS-ResNet-101 ( Snet=1-1-1-1)is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the ResNet-101 baseline on V100 (Figure 7 (a) right), even though itstheoretical computation is much smaller than that of the static model. However, larger granularities(Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=8-4-7-1) can effectively improve the inference latency due to its lower burdenon the memory access. Remarkably, the latency of ResNet-101 could be reduced by 36% and 46% onV100 and TX2 respectively without sacri\ufb01cing the accuracy when t=0.4. The classi\ufb01cation accuracyis increased by 1.9% with similar inference ef\ufb01ciency. It can be observed that the realistic speedupratio r\u2113 is more close to the theoretical FLOPs ratio target ton the less powerful TX2, because thelatency is computation-bounded (i.e. the latency is mainly spent on computation) on such IoT devices.In contrast, there is a larger gap between practical and theoretical ef\ufb01ciency on the more powerfulV100, as the latency is bounded by the memory access cost.4.3.2 Lightweight baseline comparison: RegNetsWe further evaluate our LASNet in lightweight CNN architectures,i.e. RegNets-Y [25]. Two differentsized models are tested: RegNetY-400MF and RegNetY-800MF. Compared baselines include othertypes of ef\ufb01cient models, e.g., MobileNets-v2 [28], Shuf\ufb02etNets-v2 [23] and CondenseNets [16].The results are presented in Figure 7 (b). The x-axis for the three sub-\ufb01gures are the FLOPs, thelatency on TX2, and the latency on the Nvidia nano GPU, respectively. We can observe that our8--- Page 9 ---1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2Latency on Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU (ms)76.577.077.578.078.579.0Accuracy (%) static ResNetsLAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=1-1-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-1-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1)LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=8-4-7-1)Figure 8: Ablation studies on S.

More results on image classi\ufb01cation are provided in Appendix C.2.4.4 Ablation studiesWe conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our coarse-grained spatially adaptiveinference (Sec. 3.2) and operator fusion operations (Sec. 3.4).More granularities settings. We test various granularity settings on LAS-ResNet-101 to examinethe effects of Sin different stages. The results on the Tesla-V100 GPU are presented in Figure 8. Itcan be found that the \ufb01nest granularity (Snet=1-1-1-1) leads to substantial inef\ufb01ciency despite thereduced FLOPs (cf. Figure 7 (a) left). Coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference in the \ufb01rst twostages (Snet=4-4-1-1) effectively reduces the inference latency. We further increase Sin the thirdstage to 2 and 7, and this procedure consistently improves the realistic ef\ufb01ciency on the V100 GPU.This trend also holds on the GTX 1080 GPU (see the results in Appendix C.2.Table 1: Ablation studies on operator fusion.Masker- Gather- Scatter- LatencyConv1x1 Conv3x3 Add (\xb5s)   163.2   90.1   86.7   71.4Operator fusion. We investigate the effect of ouroperator fusion introduced in Sec. 3.4. One convolu-tional block in the \ufb01rst stage of a LAS-ResNet-101(S=4, r=0.6) is tested. The results in Table 1 vali-date that every step of operator fusion bene\ufb01ts thepractical latency of a block, as the overhead onmemory access is effectively reduced. Especially,the fusion of the masker operation and the \ufb01rst con-volution is crucial to reducing the latency.4.5 VisualizationWe visualize the masks generated by our masker in the third block of a LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1) in Figure 12. The brilliant areas correspond to the locations of 1 elements in a mask, andthe computation on the dimmed regions is skipped by our dynamic model. We can witness that themasker accurately locate the most task-related regions (even the tiny aircraft at the corner), whichhelps reduce the unnecessary computation on background areas. These resultsalso suggest that forthe \ufb01rst stage, the granularity S=4 is suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02exible to recognize the important regions, anda win-win can be achieved between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. Interestingly, the masker could selectsome objects that are not labeled for the sample, e.g., the \ufb02ower beside the hummingbird and thehuman holding the camera. This indicates that our spatial-wise dynamic networks can automaticallyrecognize the regions with semantics, and their capability is not limited by the classi\ufb01cation labels.This property is helpful in some downstream tasks, such as object detection (Sec. 4.6) and instancesegmentation (Sec. 4.7), which require detecting multiple classes and objects in an image. Morevisualization results could be found in Appendix C.3.4.6 COCO Object detectionWe further evaluate our LASNet on the COCO [22] object detection task. The mean average precision(mAP), the average backbone FLOPs, and the average backbone latency on the validation set areused to measure the network performance. We test two commonly used detection frameworks: FasterR-CNN [27] with Feature Pyramid Network [20] and RetinaNet [21]. Thanks to the generality ofour method, we can conveniently replace the backbones with ours pre-trained on ImageNet, andthe whole models are \ufb01netuned on COCO with the standard setting for 12 epochs (see detailed9--- Page 10 ---Table 2: Object detection results on the COCO dataset.Detection Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)mAP (%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Faster R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 39.4LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.6) 90.7 33.8 90.6 524.9 40.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 79.3 30.7 82.5 477.1 39.8LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.5 29.0 79.9 464.8 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 67.9 25.3 69.1 401.3 39.5RetinaNetResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 38.5LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 77.8 30.4 81.8 472.6 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.5) 79.4 28.9 79.9 464.8 39.3LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 66.4 25.3 69.1 401.3 38.9Table 3: Instance Segmentation results on the COCO dataset.Segmentation Backbone Backbone Backbone Latency (ms)APmask(%) APbox(%)Framework FLOPs (G) V100 GTX1080 TX2Mask R-CNNResNet-101 (Baseline) 141.2 39.5 119.3 729.4 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.5) 80.5 31.1 83.3 481.9 37.0 41.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-2-1,t=0.4) 69.2 27.9 74.8 431.6 36.1 40.0LAS-ResNet-101 (Snet=4-4-7-1,t=0.4) 68.8 25.8 70.9 411.8 36.2 40.0setup in Appendix B.3).

We can observe from the results that when setting the training target as 0.4, the latency ofour LAS-ResNet-101 with Snet=4-4-7-1 is signi\ufb01cantly lower than the static baseline on all deviceswithout sacri\ufb01cing mAP in both detection frameworks. With a larger training targets, our LASNetcan increase the mAP by 0.9% and 0.8% in Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet respectively, while stillbeing faster than the baseline method.4.7 COCO instance segmentationWe also present the results of instance segmentation on COCO, which demonstrate the effectivenessof our LASNet on the dense prediction task. From the results in Table 3, we can observe that whensetting the training target as 0.4, the Mask R-CNN [ 10] models (Snet=4-4-2-1 and Snet=4-4-7-1)runs faster on all tested hardware devices without sacri\ufb01cing the performance. With a training targetof 0.5, the APmask and APbox of the Mask R-CNN model could be increased by 0.9% and 1.0%respectively while still running faster than the baseline method.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we propose to build latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic networks (LASNet) under theguidance of a latency prediction model. By simultaneously considering the algorithm, the schedulingstrategy and the hardware properties, we can ef\ufb01ciently estimate the practical latency of spatial-wise dynamic operators on arbitrary computing platforms. Based on the empirical analysis on therelationship between the latency and the granularity of spatially adaptive inference, we optimizeboth the algorithm and the scheduling strategies to achieve realistic speedup on many multi-coreprocessors, e.g., the Tesla V100 GPU and the Jetson TX2 GPU. Experiments on image classi\ufb01cation,object detection and instance segmentation tasks validate that the proposed method signi\ufb01cantlyimproves the practical ef\ufb01ciency of deep CNNs, and outperforms various competing approaches.AcknowledgementThis work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant2020AAA0105200, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62022048and the Tsinghua University-China Mobile Communications Group Co.,Ltd.

NeurIPS, 2021.12--- Page 13 ---AppendixA Latency prediction model.As the dynamic operators in our method have not been supported by current deep learning libraries,we propose a latency prediction model to ef\ufb01ciently estimate the real latency of these operators onhardware device. The inputs of the latency prediction model include: 1) the structural con\ufb01gurationof a convolutional block, 2) its activation rate rwhich decides the computation amount, 3) the spatialgranularity S, and 4) the hardware properties mentioned in Table 4. The latency of a dynamic blockis predicted as follows.Input/output shape de\ufb01nition. The \ufb01rst step of predicting the latency of an operation is to calculatethe shape of input and output. Taking the gather-conv2 operation as an example, the input of thisoperation is the activation with the shape of Cin \xd7H \xd7W, where Cin is the number of inputchannels, and H and W are the resolution of the feature map. The shape of the output tensor isP \xd7Cout \xd7S\xd7S, where P is the number of output patches, Cout is the number of output channelsand Sis the spatial granularity. Note that P is obtained based on the output of our maskers.Operation-to-hardware mapping. Next, we map the operations to hardware. As is mentioned in thepaper, we model a hardware device as multiple processing engines (PEs). We assign the computationof each element in the output feature map to a PE. Speci\ufb01cally, we consecutively split the outputfeature map into multiple tiles. The shape of each tile is TP \xd7TC \xd7TS1 \xd7TS2. These split tilesare assigned to multiple PEs. The computation of the elements in each tile is executed in a PE. Wecan con\ufb01gure different shapes of tiles. In order to determine the optimal shape of the tile, we makea search space of different tile shapes. The tile shape has 4 dimensions. The candidates of eachdimension are power-of-2 and do not exceed the corresponding dimension of the feature map.Latency estimation. Then, we evaluate the latency of each tile shape in the search space and selectthe optimal tile shape with the lowest latency. The latency includes the data movement latency andthe computation latency: \u2113= \u2113data + \u2113computation.1) Data movement latency \u2113data. The estimation of the latency for data movement requires us tomodel the memory system of a hardware device. We model the memory system of hardware as athree-level architecture [12]: off-chip memory, on-chip global memory, and local memory in PE.The input data and weight data are \ufb01rst transferred from the off-chip memory to the on-chip globalmemory. We assume the hardware can make full use of the off-chip memory bandwidth to simplifythe latency prediction model.After that, the data used to compute the output tiles is transferred from on-chip global memory tothe local m, Your response: ```ADD_PAPER\n2210.06223v1\nThis paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #14, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```.

In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #6, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nneural architecture search edge devices image classification\n```\nStep #7, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query neural architecture search edge devices image classification, here was the response\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput.

However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #15, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: ```EXPIRATION 3\n--- Page 1 ---An Adaptive Sampling and Edge DetectionApproach for Encoding Static Images for SpikingNeural NetworksPeyton Chandarana\u2217\u2021, Junlin Ou \u2020\u2021, Ramtin Zand \u2217\u2217Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2020Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2021Authors contributed equally.Abstract\u2014Current state-of-the-art methods of image classi\ufb01-cation using convolutional neural networks are often constrainedby both latency and power consumption. This places a limit onthe devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that can employthese methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are consideredto be the third generation of arti\ufb01cial neural networks whichaim to address these latency and power constraints by takinginspiration from biological neuronal communication processes.Before data such as images can be input into an SNN, however,they must be \ufb01rst encoded into spike trains. Herein, we proposea method for encoding static images into temporal spike trainsusing edge detection and an adaptive signal sampling methodfor use in SNNs. The edge detection process consists of \ufb01rstperforming Canny edge detection on the 2D static images andthen converting the edge detected images into two X and Ysignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptivesignaling approach consists of sampling the signals such thatthe signals maintain enough detail and are sensitive to abruptchanges in the signal. Temporal encoding mechanisms such asthreshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF) arethen able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spiketrains. We use various error and indicator metrics to optimizeand evaluate the ef\ufb01ciency and precision of the proposed imageencoding approach. Comparison results between the original andreconstructed signals from spike trains generated using edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit18\xd7 and 7 \xd7 reduction in average root mean square error(RMSE) compared to the conventional SF and TBR encoding,respectively, while used for encoding MNIST dataset.I. I NTRODUCTIONNeural encoding plays an important role in the brain-inspired neuromorphic systems, which use trains of actionpotentials, i.e. spike trains, to process the input information.Neural encoding refers to the process of representing stimulusfeatures in the form of spike trains. Before any type of learningor training can occur in spiking neural networks (SNNs), thesespike trains must \ufb01rst be produced from input data usingparticular encoding mechanisms. As also mentioned in [1],the study of neural coding can be divided into three questions,what is being encoded? how is it being encoded? and what isthe precision of the encoding?In this paper, we are focusing on the encoding of staticimages for image classi\ufb01cation with SNNs into spike trains.Two of the well-known methods for encoding static images are\ufb01ring rate-based encoding [2]\u2013[4] and population rank orderencoding [5], [6]. In the rate-based encoding, each input isa Poisson spike train with a \ufb01ring rate proportional to theintensity of the of the corresponding pixel in the image [4].Although this approach has shown to be effective in practice,it normally requires very high \ufb01ring rates, therefore it isnot computationally ef\ufb01cient [7], [8]. The population rankorder encoding utilizes receptive \ufb01elds to distribute input overseveral neurons, each of which \ufb01res only once during thecoding interval based on the extent an input value belongs to itscorresponding receptive \ufb01eld [9], [10]. This method drasticallyreduces the spikes that should be processed by network,however it signi\ufb01cantly increases the network size. Anothercommon approach is to represent the pixels of the imagethemselves as spikes and represent each pixel as a separateneuron in the input layer of the SNN [11]. This approach,however, requires a large network of neurons compared to theeven the aforementioned approaches. Even with some featurereduction in the images the network is still non-ideal in itssize and immutable input size [11]. Herein, we use temporalcoding, which is traditionally suitable for encoding time-series and streaming data, to encode static images. Temporalencoding is an ef\ufb01cient and fast method that generates spikes atexact points in time based on the change in the input stimulussignal.To encode static images into the signals needed as input tothe previously mentioned encoding algorithms, we use edgedetection along with a conversion algorithm to convert thestatic images into two signals which will then be convertedinto two separate spike trains to be input into an SNN. As men-tioned above, one of the important questions that needs to beaddressed in the neural coding is the precision of the encoding[1]. The objective here is to generate spike trains with reducednumber of spikes without losing the important informationcontent of the signal. Therefore, evaluating the ef\ufb01ciency ofthe temporal encoding mechanism becomes very important. Inthis paper, in order to assess our proposed approach, we useMNIST handwritten digits [12] as representative static images,convert them to signals, encode the signal into spike trains,reconstruct the signals and compare them with original signals,and eventually reconstruct the static MNIST images.The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section2 discusses the image-to-signal conversion approach using anedge detection algorithm. Section 3 describes the adaptive1arXiv:2110.10217v1  [cs.NE]  19 Oct 2021--- Page 2 ---Fig. 1: (a) The original image. (b) Canny edge detection out-put. (c) X coordinate signal from image (b).

Section 4 provides a thoroughevaluation of our proposed static image encoding method usingintensive simulations and introducing a new \ufb01tness function.Finally, section 5 concludes the paper by proposing possibledirections for future work.Algorithm 1: Coordinate ExtractionInput: A 2D image array of pixel intensitiesOutput: Two arrays, x & y, consisting of the x and ycomponents of pixels with intensities greaterthan zero1: x = [ ]2: y = [ ]3: for row = 1to length(image) do4: for col = 1to length(image[row]) do5: if image[row][col] > 0 then6: x.append(col)7: y.append(row)II. I MAGE -TO-SIGNAL CONVERSION METHODIn image processing, edge detection is used to \ufb01nd theedges of objects or shapes in images. This process, in general,consists of identifying where there is an abrupt change in thepattern of pixel intensities. The edge of an object representsthe object\u2019s general shape or contour and therefore aids inidentifying that object. This idea that an object\u2019s edges maycontain enough information to classify an image, is what ledus to investigate if encoding the edges of an image instead ofthe image itself would lead to a reduction in spikes in spiketrains.From here, we implemented a Python program which em-ploys the OpenCV Canny edge detection to \ufb01nd the edgesof the MNIST handwritten digit dataset [13]. Canny edgedetection consists of four different image processing steps:(1) Gaussian Filter, (2) Sobel Filters, (3) Non-maximumSuppression, and (4) Hysteresis Thresholding.The \ufb01rst two steps in the Canny edge detection processinvolve applying two \ufb01lters to the image using convolution.Convolution allows neighboring pixels around a central inputpixel to be weighted and then summed up to determine theintensity of the central output pixel in the same location asthe input pixel. In the case of Canny edge detection, a 5x5Gaussian \ufb01lter is \ufb01rst applied to smoothen the image andreduce the image noise [13].The Sobel \ufb01lter is then applied to the smoothened imageto get a preliminary edge detected image. Applying the Sobel\ufb01lter computes the \ufb01rst derivative in both the horizontal andvertical directions which corresponds to two output images.These two output images, horizontal and vertical, are thenused to \ufb01nd the edge gradient and the direction of the lineperpendicular to the tangent line of the edge [13]. The resultis an image which has pixels with higher intensities roughlywhere the edges were located.While the resulting image from applying the Sobel \ufb01lterprocess gives us the edges of the image, these edges arenot ideal and the number of edge pixels are not minimized.This is not ideal because we wish to minimize the number ofpixels that represent the edges so that the signal length andconsequently spike train length is minimized. The next stepsin Canny edge detection aid in minimizing the edge pixels.In the third step, a non-maximum suppression algorithm isused to suppress certain pixels that are not actually part of anedge. The algorithm looks at the pixels in the output of thesecond step and then, using the direction from the second step,analyzes the pixel and its surrounding pixels to determine ifit is on the edge. If the pixel is determined to not be on theedge, then its intensity is set to zero [13].The \ufb01nal step in the Canny edge detection is to use hys-teresis thresholding to eliminate any remaining pixels whichare not actual edge pixels and output an image with semi-connected thin edges. The algorithm, speci\ufb01cally, looks forpixels which have intensities higher than a given threshold anddetermines them as edge pixels. If the pixel has an intensitysmaller than a given lower threshold, then it is determinedto not be on the edge. Finally, if the pixel is between theupper and lower intensity thresholds, then pixel is determinedto be on the edge if and only if it is connected to an alreadydetermined edge pixel [13].2--- Page 3 ---After applying the Canny edge detection process, the edgesof the original image in Figure 1 (a) are detected and Figure1 (b) is generated. Figure 1 (b) is then passed into Algorithm1 to extract the X and Y coordinates of the edge pixels inthe image and create the X and Y signals which will be laterencoded into spike trains. As shown in Figure 1 (c) and (d),there is a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the length of the X and Ysignals obtained from the edge image compared to those ofthe original raw image. In particular, for a random sample of1000 MNIST digits, i.e. 100 samples of each digit 0 through9, there is a 41.7% reduction in the length of the signal foredge images compared to the original images.Algorithm 2: Temporal Encoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: s signal, SamplingThreshold ,EncodingThresholdOutput: out, startpoint, count1: count = zeros(length(s) \u22121)2: for t = 0to length(s) \u22121 do3: count[t] =ceil(abs((s[t + 1]\u2212s[t])/SamplingThreshold ))4: sa = zeros(sum(count) + 1)5: n = 06: for i = 0to length(s) \u22121 do7: for j = 0to count[t] do8: sa[n] =s[i] + (j)/count[t] \u2217(s[i + 1]\u2212s[i])9: n + = 110: sa[length(sa) \u22121] =s[length(s) \u22121]11: out, startpoint =TemporalEncoding(sa, EncodingThreshold, ...)Algorithm 3: Temporal Decoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: spikes, EncodingThreshold , startpoint,countOutput: recon1: recona =Decoding(spikes, EncodingThreshold,startpoint)2: m = 03: recon = zeros(length(count) + 1)4: for t = 0to length(count) do5: recon [t] =recona[m]6: m + =count[t]7: recon[length(recon)\u22121] =recona[length(recona)\u22121]III. A DAPTIVE TEMPORAL ENCODINGOnce the static images are converted to signals, as describedin the previous section, temporal encoding mechanisms can beused to generate spike trains from the produced signals. In thisstep, selection and optimization of temporal encoding methodsplay an important role to achieve a high precision signal-to-spike train conversion. In our initial experiments, we used theknown step-forward (SF) encoding [9] method to encode theX and Y signals obtained from edge detection. However, wenoticed that using a \ufb01xed sampling rate to encode the signalwill lead to either an overestimation (with high sampling rate)or an underestimation (with low sampling rate), which leads tohigh computation cost or low encoding precision, respectively.Thus, in this work, we propose an adaptive sampling approach,which works as a preprocessing step for temporal encodingmechanisms.The objective of the adaptive sampling is to increase thesampling rate when there are abrupt changes to the signaland reduce the sampling rate when the signal exhibits moregradual variations. The adaptive sampling algorithm for tem-poral encoding is presented in Algorithm 2. The algorithm\ufb01rst samples the signal with \ufb01xed intervals and then calculateshow many more samples, (count in Algorithm 2), are requiredbetween two consecutive points based on the change in signalbetween the two points. Next, the signal is sampled again, thistime based on the number of samples calculated in the previousstep, inserting more points for higher signal resolution basedon the rate of change. Finally, the adaptively-sampled signalis converted to a spike train using any temporal encodingmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR), SF,etc. [9], as shown in line 11 of the Algorithm 2.The adaptive sampling approach includes a sampling thresh-old which de\ufb01nes the sensitivity of the algorithm to changesin the signal. The lower the threshold value is, the moresamples will be taken (Line 3 of the Algorithm 2) between twoconsecutive points. This adaptive sampling thus optimizes theaverage \ufb01ring rate (AFR) to be seen in section IV for minimalspikes in the resulting spike trains without compromisingaccuracy.Decoding the spike trains generated by adaptive sampling-based temporal encoding approaches requires a post-processing step that is described in Algorithm 3. Once thespike trains are decoded using normal decoding methods forspike trains [9] (Line 1 of Algorithm 3), the sample countsstored in the count array during the adaptive sampling willbe used to reconstruct the original signal. Here, without lossof generality, we used the adaptive sampling approach alongwith SF and TBR methods to develop an adaptive temporalspike encoding mechanism for static images. The TBR andSF encoding algorithms and their corresponding decodingalgorithm is provided in Appendix A.IV. S IMULATION RESULTSIn this section, we evaluate our adaptive temporal encodingapproach by using MNIST handwritten digits [12] as represen-tative static images, convert them to signals, encode the signalinto spike trains, reconstruct the signals and compare themwith original signals using various indicator and error metrics.For samples of complete encoding-to-reconstruction process3--- Page 4 ---Fig. 2: Performance metrics for adaptive SF encoding using various threshold values.

We use root mean square error (RMSE)and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics to assess the precisionof the encoding approaches. SNR is de\ufb01ned asSNR = 20\xb7log Power (s)Power (s \u2212r)[dB] (1)where s is the original signal, r is the reconstructed signal,and Power is calculated asPower (s) = 1/NN\u22121\u2211k=0|s(k)|2 (2)4--- Page 5 ---where N is the number of samples. RMSE is de\ufb01ned asRMSE =\u221a\u2211Nt=1(st \u2212rt)2N (3)On the other hand, average \ufb01ring rate (AFR) and spike countmetrics are utilized to evaluate the computational ef\ufb01ciencyof encoding methods. AFR indicates how saturated the spiketrain is and is de\ufb01ned asAFR =\u2211Nt |spt|N (4)where sp is the number of all spikes in a given spike train [9].Here, the objective is increasing the SNR while decreasingRMSE, AFR and spike count. Figures 2 and 3 exhibit theperformance metrics for the adaptive and edge detected SF andTBR encoding experiments, respectively, with encoding andsampling thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 with 0.1 intervals.B. Threshold OptimizationTo co-optimize the sampling threshold in the adaptivesampling algorithm and encoding threshold in the temporal en-coding mechanisms (see Appendix A), we introduce a Fitnessfunction that combines several of the aforementioned metrics,as expressed in (5). The higher Fitness value represents betterreconstruction.Fitness = SNRRMSE \xd7SpikeCount (5)Figure 4 shows the reconstruction \ufb01tness of the adaptiveSF and TBR encoding methods for various sampling andencoding thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. The maximum\ufb01tness values for adaptive SF and TBR encoding methods areachieved at ( SamplingThreshold, EncodingThreshold) equals(0.1, 0.2) for SF and (1.0, 0.9) for TBR, respectively. Bycontrast, the optimal EncodingThreshold for non-adaptivelysampled experiments are 2.0 (X) and 1.2 (Y) for SF and2.0 (X) and 0.9 (Y) for TBR. Table I provides a comparisonbetween adaptive SF and TBR encoding with the optimizedthreshold values mentioned above. As listed in the table, TBRis more ef\ufb01cient in terms of spike count, but the SF exhibitsa greater SNR and smaller RMSE making it more desireablefor precise reconstuction. It should be noted, however, thatthe average number of spikes is greatly increased due to theadaptive sampling increasing the resolution of the signal. It isworth noting that the \ufb01tness function can be adjusted, usingm and n parameters in (6), based on the speci\ufb01c applicationrequirement to emphasize on the precision or computationef\ufb01ciency:Fitness(m, n) = SNRRMSE (m) \xd7SpikeCount (n) (6)As can be seen in table I, the lowest RMSE values occurin the experiments where adaptive sampling was used versuswithout adaptive sampling. The average number of spikes in allcases where edge detection was used does marginally reducethe number of spikes.Fig. 4: Fitness plots. (a)-(b) The X signal.

C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKIn this paper, we proposed an adaptive temporal encodingmethod to convert the static images into spike trains. Theproposed encoding approach aims to allow static images tobe processed by SNNs with smaller networks, using only twoinputs x and y. However, when it comes to temporal encoding,the encoding precision becomes very important. Therefore, weperformed intensive simulations to evaluate and optimize ourproposed encoding approach. We introduced a novel \ufb01tnessfunction which combines the accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency metricsto optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed adaptive tem-poral encoding. The results obtained exhibit an accurate spikeencoding of MNIST handwritten digits as representative staticimages. Future work includes evaluating the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach for the whole SNN application through5--- Page 6 ---implementing it on neuromorphic hardware, e.g. Loihi [14],for image classi\ufb01cation application on a variety of datasets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work is partially supported by an ASPIRE grant fromthe Of\ufb01ce of the Vice President for Research at the Universityof South Carolina.REFERENCES[1] A.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices.

We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations. Our resulting architecture outperforms MLPerf MobileNetV1\nby 6.3% accuracy improvement with 3.5x less number of parameters on Visual Wake\nWords.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-08\narXiv paper ID: 2303.04440v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2307.04443v1\n```\nStep #9, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2307.04443v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification latency optimization\n```\nStep #10, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification latency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images.

A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #15, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---An Adaptive Sampling and Edge DetectionApproach for Encoding Static Images for SpikingNeural NetworksPeyton Chandarana\u2217\u2021, Junlin Ou \u2020\u2021, Ramtin Zand \u2217\u2217Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2020Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2021Authors contributed equally.Abstract\u2014Current state-of-the-art methods of image classi\ufb01-cation using convolutional neural networks are often constrainedby both latency and power consumption.

I NTRODUCTIONNeural encoding plays an important role in the brain-inspired neuromorphic systems, which use trains of actionpotentials, i.e. spike trains, to process the input information.Neural encoding refers to the process of representing stimulusfeatures in the form of spike trains. Before any type of learningor training can occur in spiking neural networks (SNNs), thesespike trains must \ufb01rst be produced from input data usingparticular encoding mechanisms. As also mentioned in [1],the study of neural coding can be divided into three questions,what is being encoded? how is it being encoded? and what isthe precision of the encoding?In this paper, we are focusing on the encoding of staticimages for image classi\ufb01cation with SNNs into spike trains.Two of the well-known methods for encoding static images are\ufb01ring rate-based encoding [2]\u2013[4] and population rank orderencoding [5], [6]. In the rate-based encoding, each input isa Poisson spike train with a \ufb01ring rate proportional to theintensity of the of the corresponding pixel in the image [4].Although this approach has shown to be effective in practice,it normally requires very high \ufb01ring rates, therefore it isnot computationally ef\ufb01cient [7], [8]. The population rankorder encoding utilizes receptive \ufb01elds to distribute input overseveral neurons, each of which \ufb01res only once during thecoding interval based on the extent an input value belongs to itscorresponding receptive \ufb01eld [9], [10]. This method drasticallyreduces the spikes that should be processed by network,however it signi\ufb01cantly increases the network size. Anothercommon approach is to represent the pixels of the imagethemselves as spikes and represent each pixel as a separateneuron in the input layer of the SNN [11]. This approach,however, requires a large network of neurons compared to theeven the aforementioned approaches. Even with some featurereduction in the images the network is still non-ideal in itssize and immutable input size [11]. Herein, we use temporalcoding, which is traditionally suitable for encoding time-series and streaming data, to encode static images. Temporalencoding is an ef\ufb01cient and fast method that generates spikes atexact points in time based on the change in the input stimulussignal.To encode static images into the signals needed as input tothe previously mentioned encoding algorithms, we use edgedetection along with a conversion algorithm to convert thestatic images into two signals which will then be convertedinto two separate spike trains to be input into an SNN. As men-tioned above, one of the important questions that needs to beaddressed in the neural coding is the precision of the encoding[1]. The objective here is to generate spike trains with reducednumber of spikes without losing the important informationcontent of the signal. Therefore, evaluating the ef\ufb01ciency ofthe temporal encoding mechanism becomes very important. Inthis paper, in order to assess our proposed approach, we useMNIST handwritten digits [12] as representative static images,convert them to signals, encode the signal into spike trains,reconstruct the signals and compare them with original signals,and eventually reconstruct the static MNIST images.The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section2 discusses the image-to-signal conversion approach using anedge detection algorithm. Section 3 describes the adaptive1arXiv:2110.10217v1  [cs.NE]  19 Oct 2021--- Page 2 ---Fig. 1: (a) The original image. (b) Canny edge detection out-put. (c) X coordinate signal from image (b).

Section 4 provides a thoroughevaluation of our proposed static image encoding method usingintensive simulations and introducing a new \ufb01tness function.Finally, section 5 concludes the paper by proposing possibledirections for future work.Algorithm 1: Coordinate ExtractionInput: A 2D image array of pixel intensitiesOutput: Two arrays, x & y, consisting of the x and ycomponents of pixels with intensities greaterthan zero1: x = [ ]2: y = [ ]3: for row = 1to length(image) do4: for col = 1to length(image[row]) do5: if image[row][col] > 0 then6: x.append(col)7: y.append(row)II. I MAGE -TO-SIGNAL CONVERSION METHODIn image processing, edge detection is used to \ufb01nd theedges of objects or shapes in images. This process, in general,consists of identifying where there is an abrupt change in thepattern of pixel intensities. The edge of an object representsthe object\u2019s general shape or contour and therefore aids inidentifying that object. This idea that an object\u2019s edges maycontain enough information to classify an image, is what ledus to investigate if encoding the edges of an image instead ofthe image itself would lead to a reduction in spikes in spiketrains.From here, we implemented a Python program which em-ploys the OpenCV Canny edge detection to \ufb01nd the edgesof the MNIST handwritten digit dataset [13]. Canny edgedetection consists of four different image processing steps:(1) Gaussian Filter, (2) Sobel Filters, (3) Non-maximumSuppression, and (4) Hysteresis Thresholding.The \ufb01rst two steps in the Canny edge detection processinvolve applying two \ufb01lters to the image using convolution.Convolution allows neighboring pixels around a central inputpixel to be weighted and then summed up to determine theintensity of the central output pixel in the same location asthe input pixel. In the case of Canny edge detection, a 5x5Gaussian \ufb01lter is \ufb01rst applied to smoothen the image andreduce the image noise [13].The Sobel \ufb01lter is then applied to the smoothened imageto get a preliminary edge detected image. Applying the Sobel\ufb01lter computes the \ufb01rst derivative in both the horizontal andvertical directions which corresponds to two output images.These two output images, horizontal and vertical, are thenused to \ufb01nd the edge gradient and the direction of the lineperpendicular to the tangent line of the edge [13]. The resultis an image which has pixels with higher intensities roughlywhere the edges were located.While the resulting image from applying the Sobel \ufb01lterprocess gives us the edges of the image, these edges arenot ideal and the number of edge pixels are not minimized.This is not ideal because we wish to minimize the number ofpixels that represent the edges so that the signal length andconsequently spike train length is minimized. The next stepsin Canny edge detection aid in minimizing the edge pixels.In the third step, a non-maximum suppression algorithm isused to suppress certain pixels that are not actually part of anedge. The algorithm looks at the pixels in the output of thesecond step and then, using the direction from the second step,analyzes the pixel and its surrounding pixels to determine ifit is on the edge. If the pixel is determined to not be on theedge, then its intensity is set to zero [13].The \ufb01nal step in the Canny edge detection is to use hys-teresis thresholding to eliminate any remaining pixels whichare not actual edge pixels and output an image with semi-connected thin edges. The algorithm, speci\ufb01cally, looks forpixels which have intensities higher than a given threshold anddetermines them as edge pixels. If the pixel has an intensitysmaller than a given lower threshold, then it is determinedto not be on the edge. Finally, if the pixel is between theupper and lower intensity thresholds, then pixel is determinedto be on the edge if and only if it is connected to an alreadydetermined edge pixel [13].2--- Page 3 ---After applying the Canny edge detection process, the edgesof the original image in Figure 1 (a) are detected and Figure1 (b) is generated. Figure 1 (b) is then passed into Algorithm1 to extract the X and Y coordinates of the edge pixels inthe image and create the X and Y signals which will be laterencoded into spike trains. As shown in Figure 1 (c) and (d),there is a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the length of the X and Ysignals obtained from the edge image compared to those ofthe original raw image. In particular, for a random sample of1000 MNIST digits, i.e. 100 samples of each digit 0 through9, there is a 41.7% reduction in the length of the signal foredge images compared to the original images.Algorithm 2: Temporal Encoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: s signal, SamplingThreshold ,EncodingThresholdOutput: out, startpoint, count1: count = zeros(length(s) \u22121)2: for t = 0to length(s) \u22121 do3: count[t] =ceil(abs((s[t + 1]\u2212s[t])/SamplingThreshold ))4: sa = zeros(sum(count) + 1)5: n = 06: for i = 0to length(s) \u22121 do7: for j = 0to count[t] do8: sa[n] =s[i] + (j)/count[t] \u2217(s[i + 1]\u2212s[i])9: n + = 110: sa[length(sa) \u22121] =s[length(s) \u22121]11: out, startpoint =TemporalEncoding(sa, EncodingThreshold, ...)Algorithm 3: Temporal Decoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: spikes, EncodingThreshold , startpoint,countOutput: recon1: recona =Decoding(spikes, EncodingThreshold,startpoint)2: m = 03: recon = zeros(length(count) + 1)4: for t = 0to length(count) do5: recon [t] =recona[m]6: m + =count[t]7: recon[length(recon)\u22121] =recona[length(recona)\u22121]III. A DAPTIVE TEMPORAL ENCODINGOnce the static images are converted to signals, as describedin the previous section, temporal encoding mechanisms can beused to generate spike trains from the produced signals. In thisstep, selection and optimization of temporal encoding methodsplay an important role to achieve a high precision signal-to-spike train conversion. In our initial experiments, we used theknown step-forward (SF) encoding [9] method to encode theX and Y signals obtained from edge detection. However, wenoticed that using a \ufb01xed sampling rate to encode the signalwill lead to either an overestimation (with high sampling rate)or an underestimation (with low sampling rate), which leads tohigh computation cost or low encoding precision, respectively.Thus, in this work, we propose an adaptive sampling approach,which works as a preprocessing step for temporal encodingmechanisms.The objective of the adaptive sampling is to increase thesampling rate when there are abrupt changes to the signaland reduce the sampling rate when the signal exhibits moregradual variations. The adaptive sampling algorithm for tem-poral encoding is presented in Algorithm 2. The algorithm\ufb01rst samples the signal with \ufb01xed intervals and then calculateshow many more samples, (count in Algorithm 2), are requiredbetween two consecutive points based on the change in signalbetween the two points. Next, the signal is sampled again, thistime based on the number of samples calculated in the previousstep, inserting more points for higher signal resolution basedon the rate of change. Finally, the adaptively-sampled signalis converted to a spike train using any temporal encodingmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR), SF,etc. [9], as shown in line 11 of the Algorithm 2.The adaptive sampling approach includes a sampling thresh-old which de\ufb01nes the sensitivity of the algorithm to changesin the signal. The lower the threshold value is, the moresamples will be taken (Line 3 of the Algorithm 2) between twoconsecutive points. This adaptive sampling thus optimizes theaverage \ufb01ring rate (AFR) to be seen in section IV for minimalspikes in the resulting spike trains without compromisingaccuracy.Decoding the spike trains generated by adaptive sampling-based temporal encoding approaches requires a post-processing step that is described in Algorithm 3. Once thespike trains are decoded using normal decoding methods forspike trains [9] (Line 1 of Algorithm 3), the sample countsstored in the count array during the adaptive sampling willbe used to reconstruct the original signal. Here, without lossof generality, we used the adaptive sampling approach alongwith SF and TBR methods to develop an adaptive temporalspike encoding mechanism for static images. The TBR andSF encoding algorithms and their corresponding decodingalgorithm is provided in Appendix A.IV. S IMULATION RESULTSIn this section, we evaluate our adaptive temporal encodingapproach by using MNIST handwritten digits [12] as represen-tative static images, convert them to signals, encode the signalinto spike trains, reconstruct the signals and compare themwith original signals using various indicator and error metrics.For samples of complete encoding-to-reconstruction process3--- Page 4 ---Fig. 2: Performance metrics for adaptive SF encoding using various threshold values.

We use root mean square error (RMSE)and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics to assess the precisionof the encoding approaches. SNR is de\ufb01ned asSNR = 20\xb7log Power (s)Power (s \u2212r)[dB] (1)where s is the original signal, r is the reconstructed signal,and Power is calculated asPower (s) = 1/NN\u22121\u2211k=0|s(k)|2 (2)4--- Page 5 ---where N is the number of samples. RMSE is de\ufb01ned asRMSE =\u221a\u2211Nt=1(st \u2212rt)2N (3)On the other hand, average \ufb01ring rate (AFR) and spike countmetrics are utilized to evaluate the computational ef\ufb01ciencyof encoding methods. AFR indicates how saturated the spiketrain is and is de\ufb01ned asAFR =\u2211Nt |spt|N (4)where sp is the number of all spikes in a given spike train [9].Here, the objective is increasing the SNR while decreasingRMSE, AFR and spike count. Figures 2 and 3 exhibit theperformance metrics for the adaptive and edge detected SF andTBR encoding experiments, respectively, with encoding andsampling thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 with 0.1 intervals.B. Threshold OptimizationTo co-optimize the sampling threshold in the adaptivesampling algorithm and encoding threshold in the temporal en-coding mechanisms (see Appendix A), we introduce a Fitnessfunction that combines several of the aforementioned metrics,as expressed in (5). The higher Fitness value represents betterreconstruction.Fitness = SNRRMSE \xd7SpikeCount (5)Figure 4 shows the reconstruction \ufb01tness of the adaptiveSF and TBR encoding methods for various sampling andencoding thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. The maximum\ufb01tness values for adaptive SF and TBR encoding methods areachieved at ( SamplingThreshold, EncodingThreshold) equals(0.1, 0.2) for SF and (1.0, 0.9) for TBR, respectively. Bycontrast, the optimal EncodingThreshold for non-adaptivelysampled experiments are 2.0 (X) and 1.2 (Y) for SF and2.0 (X) and 0.9 (Y) for TBR. Table I provides a comparisonbetween adaptive SF and TBR encoding with the optimizedthreshold values mentioned above. As listed in the table, TBRis more ef\ufb01cient in terms of spike count, but the SF exhibitsa greater SNR and smaller RMSE making it more desireablefor precise reconstuction. It should be noted, however, thatthe average number of spikes is greatly increased due to theadaptive sampling increasing the resolution of the signal. It isworth noting that the \ufb01tness function can be adjusted, usingm and n parameters in (6), based on the speci\ufb01c applicationrequirement to emphasize on the precision or computationef\ufb01ciency:Fitness(m, n) = SNRRMSE (m) \xd7SpikeCount (n) (6)As can be seen in table I, the lowest RMSE values occurin the experiments where adaptive sampling was used versuswithout adaptive sampling. The average number of spikes in allcases where edge detection was used does marginally reducethe number of spikes.Fig. 4: Fitness plots. (a)-(b) The X signal.

C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKIn this paper, we proposed an adaptive temporal encodingmethod to convert the static images into spike trains. Theproposed encoding approach aims to allow static images tobe processed by SNNs with smaller networks, using only twoinputs x and y. However, when it comes to temporal encoding,the encoding precision becomes very important. Therefore, weperformed intensive simulations to evaluate and optimize ourproposed encoding approach. We introduced a novel \ufb01tnessfunction which combines the accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency metricsto optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed adaptive tem-poral encoding. The results obtained exhibit an accurate spikeencoding of MNIST handwritten digits as representative staticimages. Future work includes evaluating the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach for the whole SNN application through5--- Page 6 ---implementing it on neuromorphic hardware, e.g. Loihi [14],for image classi\ufb01cation application on a variety of datasets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work is partially supported by an ASPIRE grant fromthe Of\ufb01ce of the Vice President for Research at the Universityof South Carolina.REFERENCES[1] A.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Effective Features of Remote Sensing Image Classification Using Interactive Adaptive Thresholding Method\nSummary: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways\nto extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers. On Pixel 4's Edge TPU, these models improve the\naccuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA mobile models.\nPublication Date: 2020-03-05\narXiv paper ID: 2003.02838v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #15, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---An Adaptive Sampling and Edge DetectionApproach for Encoding Static Images for SpikingNeural NetworksPeyton Chandarana\u2217\u2021, Junlin Ou \u2020\u2021, Ramtin Zand \u2217\u2217Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2020Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2021Authors contributed equally.Abstract\u2014Current state-of-the-art methods of image classi\ufb01-cation using convolutional neural networks are often constrainedby both latency and power consumption.

I NTRODUCTIONNeural encoding plays an important role in the brain-inspired neuromorphic systems, which use trains of actionpotentials, i.e. spike trains, to process the input information.Neural encoding refers to the process of representing stimulusfeatures in the form of spike trains. Before any type of learningor training can occur in spiking neural networks (SNNs), thesespike trains must \ufb01rst be produced from input data usingparticular encoding mechanisms. As also mentioned in [1],the study of neural coding can be divided into three questions,what is being encoded? how is it being encoded? and what isthe precision of the encoding?In this paper, we are focusing on the encoding of staticimages for image classi\ufb01cation with SNNs into spike trains.Two of the well-known methods for encoding static images are\ufb01ring rate-based encoding [2]\u2013[4] and population rank orderencoding [5], [6]. In the rate-based encoding, each input isa Poisson spike train with a \ufb01ring rate proportional to theintensity of the of the corresponding pixel in the image [4].Although this approach has shown to be effective in practice,it normally requires very high \ufb01ring rates, therefore it isnot computationally ef\ufb01cient [7], [8]. The population rankorder encoding utilizes receptive \ufb01elds to distribute input overseveral neurons, each of which \ufb01res only once during thecoding interval based on the extent an input value belongs to itscorresponding receptive \ufb01eld [9], [10]. This method drasticallyreduces the spikes that should be processed by network,however it signi\ufb01cantly increases the network size. Anothercommon approach is to represent the pixels of the imagethemselves as spikes and represent each pixel as a separateneuron in the input layer of the SNN [11]. This approach,however, requires a large network of neurons compared to theeven the aforementioned approaches. Even with some featurereduction in the images the network is still non-ideal in itssize and immutable input size [11]. Herein, we use temporalcoding, which is traditionally suitable for encoding time-series and streaming data, to encode static images. Temporalencoding is an ef\ufb01cient and fast method that generates spikes atexact points in time based on the change in the input stimulussignal.To encode static images into the signals needed as input tothe previously mentioned encoding algorithms, we use edgedetection along with a conversion algorithm to convert thestatic images into two signals which will then be convertedinto two separate spike trains to be input into an SNN. As men-tioned above, one of the important questions that needs to beaddressed in the neural coding is the precision of the encoding[1]. The objective here is to generate spike trains with reducednumber of spikes without losing the important informationcontent of the signal. Therefore, evaluating the ef\ufb01ciency ofthe temporal encoding mechanism becomes very important. Inthis paper, in order to assess our proposed approach, we useMNIST handwritten digits [12] as representative static images,convert them to signals, encode the signal into spike trains,reconstruct the signals and compare them with original signals,and eventually reconstruct the static MNIST images.The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section2 discusses the image-to-signal conversion approach using anedge detection algorithm. Section 3 describes the adaptive1arXiv:2110.10217v1  [cs.NE]  19 Oct 2021--- Page 2 ---Fig. 1: (a) The original image. (b) Canny edge detection out-put. (c) X coordinate signal from image (b).

Section 4 provides a thoroughevaluation of our proposed static image encoding method usingintensive simulations and introducing a new \ufb01tness function.Finally, section 5 concludes the paper by proposing possibledirections for future work.Algorithm 1: Coordinate ExtractionInput: A 2D image array of pixel intensitiesOutput: Two arrays, x & y, consisting of the x and ycomponents of pixels with intensities greaterthan zero1: x = [ ]2: y = [ ]3: for row = 1to length(image) do4: for col = 1to length(image[row]) do5: if image[row][col] > 0 then6: x.append(col)7: y.append(row)II. I MAGE -TO-SIGNAL CONVERSION METHODIn image processing, edge detection is used to \ufb01nd theedges of objects or shapes in images. This process, in general,consists of identifying where there is an abrupt change in thepattern of pixel intensities. The edge of an object representsthe object\u2019s general shape or contour and therefore aids inidentifying that object. This idea that an object\u2019s edges maycontain enough information to classify an image, is what ledus to investigate if encoding the edges of an image instead ofthe image itself would lead to a reduction in spikes in spiketrains.From here, we implemented a Python program which em-ploys the OpenCV Canny edge detection to \ufb01nd the edgesof the MNIST handwritten digit dataset [13]. Canny edgedetection consists of four different image processing steps:(1) Gaussian Filter, (2) Sobel Filters, (3) Non-maximumSuppression, and (4) Hysteresis Thresholding.The \ufb01rst two steps in the Canny edge detection processinvolve applying two \ufb01lters to the image using convolution.Convolution allows neighboring pixels around a central inputpixel to be weighted and then summed up to determine theintensity of the central output pixel in the same location asthe input pixel. In the case of Canny edge detection, a 5x5Gaussian \ufb01lter is \ufb01rst applied to smoothen the image andreduce the image noise [13].The Sobel \ufb01lter is then applied to the smoothened imageto get a preliminary edge detected image. Applying the Sobel\ufb01lter computes the \ufb01rst derivative in both the horizontal andvertical directions which corresponds to two output images.These two output images, horizontal and vertical, are thenused to \ufb01nd the edge gradient and the direction of the lineperpendicular to the tangent line of the edge [13]. The resultis an image which has pixels with higher intensities roughlywhere the edges were located.While the resulting image from applying the Sobel \ufb01lterprocess gives us the edges of the image, these edges arenot ideal and the number of edge pixels are not minimized.This is not ideal because we wish to minimize the number ofpixels that represent the edges so that the signal length andconsequently spike train length is minimized. The next stepsin Canny edge detection aid in minimizing the edge pixels.In the third step, a non-maximum suppression algorithm isused to suppress certain pixels that are not actually part of anedge. The algorithm looks at the pixels in the output of thesecond step and then, using the direction from the second step,analyzes the pixel and its surrounding pixels to determine ifit is on the edge. If the pixel is determined to not be on theedge, then its intensity is set to zero [13].The \ufb01nal step in the Canny edge detection is to use hys-teresis thresholding to eliminate any remaining pixels whichare not actual edge pixels and output an image with semi-connected thin edges. The algorithm, speci\ufb01cally, looks forpixels which have intensities higher than a given threshold anddetermines them as edge pixels. If the pixel has an intensitysmaller than a given lower threshold, then it is determinedto not be on the edge. Finally, if the pixel is between theupper and lower intensity thresholds, then pixel is determinedto be on the edge if and only if it is connected to an alreadydetermined edge pixel [13].2--- Page 3 ---After applying the Canny edge detection process, the edgesof the original image in Figure 1 (a) are detected and Figure1 (b) is generated. Figure 1 (b) is then passed into Algorithm1 to extract the X and Y coordinates of the edge pixels inthe image and create the X and Y signals which will be laterencoded into spike trains. As shown in Figure 1 (c) and (d),there is a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the length of the X and Ysignals obtained from the edge image compared to those ofthe original raw image. In particular, for a random sample of1000 MNIST digits, i.e. 100 samples of each digit 0 through9, there is a 41.7% reduction in the length of the signal foredge images compared to the original images.Algorithm 2: Temporal Encoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: s signal, SamplingThreshold ,EncodingThresholdOutput: out, startpoint, count1: count = zeros(length(s) \u22121)2: for t = 0to length(s) \u22121 do3: count[t] =ceil(abs((s[t + 1]\u2212s[t])/SamplingThreshold ))4: sa = zeros(sum(count) + 1)5: n = 06: for i = 0to length(s) \u22121 do7: for j = 0to count[t] do8: sa[n] =s[i] + (j)/count[t] \u2217(s[i + 1]\u2212s[i])9: n + = 110: sa[length(sa) \u22121] =s[length(s) \u22121]11: out, startpoint =TemporalEncoding(sa, EncodingThreshold, ...)Algorithm 3: Temporal Decoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: spikes, EncodingThreshold , startpoint,countOutput: recon1: recona =Decoding(spikes, EncodingThreshold,startpoint)2: m = 03: recon = zeros(length(count) + 1)4: for t = 0to length(count) do5: recon [t] =recona[m]6: m + =count[t]7: recon[length(recon)\u22121] =recona[length(recona)\u22121]III. A DAPTIVE TEMPORAL ENCODINGOnce the static images are converted to signals, as describedin the previous section, temporal encoding mechanisms can beused to generate spike trains from the produced signals. In thisstep, selection and optimization of temporal encoding methodsplay an important role to achieve a high precision signal-to-spike train conversion. In our initial experiments, we used theknown step-forward (SF) encoding [9] method to encode theX and Y signals obtained from edge detection. However, wenoticed that using a \ufb01xed sampling rate to encode the signalwill lead to either an overestimation (with high sampling rate)or an underestimation (with low sampling rate), which leads tohigh computation cost or low encoding precision, respectively.Thus, in this work, we propose an adaptive sampling approach,which works as a preprocessing step for temporal encodingmechanisms.The objective of the adaptive sampling is to increase thesampling rate when there are abrupt changes to the signaland reduce the sampling rate when the signal exhibits moregradual variations. The adaptive sampling algorithm for tem-poral encoding is presented in Algorithm 2. The algorithm\ufb01rst samples the signal with \ufb01xed intervals and then calculateshow many more samples, (count in Algorithm 2), are requiredbetween two consecutive points based on the change in signalbetween the two points. Next, the signal is sampled again, thistime based on the number of samples calculated in the previousstep, inserting more points for higher signal resolution basedon the rate of change. Finally, the adaptively-sampled signalis converted to a spike train using any temporal encodingmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR), SF,etc. [9], as shown in line 11 of the Algorithm 2.The adaptive sampling approach includes a sampling thresh-old which de\ufb01nes the sensitivity of the algorithm to changesin the signal. The lower the threshold value is, the moresamples will be taken (Line 3 of the Algorithm 2) between twoconsecutive points. This adaptive sampling thus optimizes theaverage \ufb01ring rate (AFR) to be seen in section IV for minimalspikes in the resulting spike trains without compromisingaccuracy.Decoding the spike trains generated by adaptive sampling-based temporal encoding approaches requires a post-processing step that is described in Algorithm 3. Once thespike trains are decoded using normal decoding methods forspike trains [9] (Line 1 of Algorithm 3), the sample countsstored in the count array during the adaptive sampling willbe used to reconstruct the original signal. Here, without lossof generality, we used the adaptive sampling approach alongwith SF and TBR methods to develop an adaptive temporalspike encoding mechanism for static images. The TBR andSF encoding algorithms and their corresponding decodingalgorithm is provided in Appendix A.IV. S IMULATION RESULTSIn this section, we evaluate our adaptive temporal encodingapproach by using MNIST handwritten digits [12] as represen-tative static images, convert them to signals, encode the signalinto spike trains, reconstruct the signals and compare themwith original signals using various indicator and error metrics.For samples of complete encoding-to-reconstruction process3--- Page 4 ---Fig. 2: Performance metrics for adaptive SF encoding using various threshold values.

(a)-(d) X signal, and (e)-(h) Y signal.on MNIST 0-9 digits images, readers can refer to AppendixB.A. Error and indicator MetricsHere, the difference between the original and reconstructedsignals is considered to assess the precision and ef\ufb01ciency ofthe encoding methods. We use root mean square error (RMSE)and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics to assess the precisionof the encoding approaches. SNR is de\ufb01ned asSNR = 20\xb7log Power (s)Power (s \u2212r)[dB] (1)where s is the original signal, r is the reconstructed signal,and Power is calculated asPower (s) = 1/NN\u22121\u2211k=0|s(k)|2 (2)4--- Page 5 ---where N is the number of samples. RMSE is de\ufb01ned asRMSE =\u221a\u2211Nt=1(st \u2212rt)2N (3)On the other hand, average \ufb01ring rate (AFR) and spike countmetrics are utilized to evaluate the computational ef\ufb01ciencyof encoding methods. AFR indicates how saturated the spiketrain is and is de\ufb01ned asAFR =\u2211Nt |spt|N (4)where sp is the number of all spikes in a given spike train [9].Here, the objective is increasing the SNR while decreasingRMSE, AFR and spike count. Figures 2 and 3 exhibit theperformance metrics for the adaptive and edge detected SF andTBR encoding experiments, respectively, with encoding andsampling thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 with 0.1 intervals.B. Threshold OptimizationTo co-optimize the sampling threshold in the adaptivesampling algorithm and encoding threshold in the temporal en-coding mechanisms (see Appendix A), we introduce a Fitnessfunction that combines several of the aforementioned metrics,as expressed in (5). The higher Fitness value represents betterreconstruction.Fitness = SNRRMSE \xd7SpikeCount (5)Figure 4 shows the reconstruction \ufb01tness of the adaptiveSF and TBR encoding methods for various sampling andencoding thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. The maximum\ufb01tness values for adaptive SF and TBR encoding methods areachieved at ( SamplingThreshold, EncodingThreshold) equals(0.1, 0.2) for SF and (1.0, 0.9) for TBR, respectively. Bycontrast, the optimal EncodingThreshold for non-adaptivelysampled experiments are 2.0 (X) and 1.2 (Y) for SF and2.0 (X) and 0.9 (Y) for TBR. Table I provides a comparisonbetween adaptive SF and TBR encoding with the optimizedthreshold values mentioned above. As listed in the table, TBRis more ef\ufb01cient in terms of spike count, but the SF exhibitsa greater SNR and smaller RMSE making it more desireablefor precise reconstuction. It should be noted, however, thatthe average number of spikes is greatly increased due to theadaptive sampling increasing the resolution of the signal. It isworth noting that the \ufb01tness function can be adjusted, usingm and n parameters in (6), based on the speci\ufb01c applicationrequirement to emphasize on the precision or computationef\ufb01ciency:Fitness(m, n) = SNRRMSE (m) \xd7SpikeCount (n) (6)As can be seen in table I, the lowest RMSE values occurin the experiments where adaptive sampling was used versuswithout adaptive sampling. The average number of spikes in allcases where edge detection was used does marginally reducethe number of spikes.Fig. 4: Fitness plots. (a)-(b) The X signal.

C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKIn this paper, we proposed an adaptive temporal encodingmethod to convert the static images into spike trains. Theproposed encoding approach aims to allow static images tobe processed by SNNs with smaller networks, using only twoinputs x and y. However, when it comes to temporal encoding,the encoding precision becomes very important. Therefore, weperformed intensive simulations to evaluate and optimize ourproposed encoding approach. We introduced a novel \ufb01tnessfunction which combines the accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency metricsto optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed adaptive tem-poral encoding. The results obtained exhibit an accurate spikeencoding of MNIST handwritten digits as representative staticimages. Future work includes evaluating the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach for the whole SNN application through5--- Page 6 ---implementing it on neuromorphic hardware, e.g. Loihi [14],for image classi\ufb01cation application on a variety of datasets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work is partially supported by an ASPIRE grant fromthe Of\ufb01ce of the Vice President for Research at the Universityof South Carolina.REFERENCES[1] A.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #15, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---An Adaptive Sampling and Edge DetectionApproach for Encoding Static Images for SpikingNeural NetworksPeyton Chandarana\u2217\u2021, Junlin Ou \u2020\u2021, Ramtin Zand \u2217\u2217Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2020Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\u2021Authors contributed equally.Abstract\u2014Current state-of-the-art methods of image classi\ufb01-cation using convolutional neural networks are often constrainedby both latency and power consumption. This places a limit onthe devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that can employthese methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are consideredto be the third generation of arti\ufb01cial neural networks whichaim to address these latency and power constraints by takinginspiration from biological neuronal communication processes.Before data such as images can be input into an SNN, however,they must be \ufb01rst encoded into spike trains. Herein, we proposea method for encoding static images into temporal spike trainsusing edge detection and an adaptive signal sampling methodfor use in SNNs. The edge detection process consists of \ufb01rstperforming Canny edge detection on the 2D static images andthen converting the edge detected images into two X and Ysignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptivesignaling approach consists of sampling the signals such thatthe signals maintain enough detail and are sensitive to abruptchanges in the signal. Temporal encoding mechanisms such asthreshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF) arethen able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spiketrains. We use various error and indicator metrics to optimizeand evaluate the ef\ufb01ciency and precision of the proposed imageencoding approach. Comparison results between the original andreconstructed signals from spike trains generated using edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit18\xd7 and 7 \xd7 reduction in average root mean square error(RMSE) compared to the conventional SF and TBR encoding,respectively, while used for encoding MNIST dataset.I. I NTRODUCTIONNeural encoding plays an important role in the brain-inspired neuromorphic systems, which use trains of actionpotentials, i.e. spike trains, to process the input information.Neural encoding refers to the process of representing stimulusfeatures in the form of spike trains. Before any type of learningor training can occur in spiking neural networks (SNNs), thesespike trains must \ufb01rst be produced from input data usingparticular encoding mechanisms. As also mentioned in [1],the study of neural coding can be divided into three questions,what is being encoded? how is it being encoded? and what isthe precision of the encoding?In this paper, we are focusing on the encoding of staticimages for image classi\ufb01cation with SNNs into spike trains.Two of the well-known methods for encoding static images are\ufb01ring rate-based encoding [2]\u2013[4] and population rank orderencoding [5], [6]. In the rate-based encoding, each input isa Poisson spike train with a \ufb01ring rate proportional to theintensity of the of the corresponding pixel in the image [4].Although this approach has shown to be effective in practice,it normally requires very high \ufb01ring rates, therefore it isnot computationally ef\ufb01cient [7], [8]. The population rankorder encoding utilizes receptive \ufb01elds to distribute input overseveral neurons, each of which \ufb01res only once during thecoding interval based on the extent an input value belongs to itscorresponding receptive \ufb01eld [9], [10]. This method drasticallyreduces the spikes that should be processed by network,however it signi\ufb01cantly increases the network size. Anothercommon approach is to represent the pixels of the imagethemselves as spikes and represent each pixel as a separateneuron in the input layer of the SNN [11]. This approach,however, requires a large network of neurons compared to theeven the aforementioned approaches. Even with some featurereduction in the images the network is still non-ideal in itssize and immutable input size [11]. Herein, we use temporalcoding, which is traditionally suitable for encoding time-series and streaming data, to encode static images. Temporalencoding is an ef\ufb01cient and fast method that generates spikes atexact points in time based on the change in the input stimulussignal.To encode static images into the signals needed as input tothe previously mentioned encoding algorithms, we use edgedetection along with a conversion algorithm to convert thestatic images into two signals which will then be convertedinto two separate spike trains to be input into an SNN. As men-tioned above, one of the important questions that needs to beaddressed in the neural coding is the precision of the encoding[1]. The objective here is to generate spike trains with reducednumber of spikes without losing the important informationcontent of the signal. Therefore, evaluating the ef\ufb01ciency ofthe temporal encoding mechanism becomes very important. Inthis paper, in order to assess our proposed approach, we useMNIST handwritten digits [12] as representative static images,convert them to signals, encode the signal into spike trains,reconstruct the signals and compare them with original signals,and eventually reconstruct the static MNIST images.The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section2 discusses the image-to-signal conversion approach using anedge detection algorithm. Section 3 describes the adaptive1arXiv:2110.10217v1  [cs.NE]  19 Oct 2021--- Page 2 ---Fig. 1: (a) The original image. (b) Canny edge detection out-put. (c) X coordinate signal from image (b).

Section 4 provides a thoroughevaluation of our proposed static image encoding method usingintensive simulations and introducing a new \ufb01tness function.Finally, section 5 concludes the paper by proposing possibledirections for future work.Algorithm 1: Coordinate ExtractionInput: A 2D image array of pixel intensitiesOutput: Two arrays, x & y, consisting of the x and ycomponents of pixels with intensities greaterthan zero1: x = [ ]2: y = [ ]3: for row = 1to length(image) do4: for col = 1to length(image[row]) do5: if image[row][col] > 0 then6: x.append(col)7: y.append(row)II. I MAGE -TO-SIGNAL CONVERSION METHODIn image processing, edge detection is used to \ufb01nd theedges of objects or shapes in images. This process, in general,consists of identifying where there is an abrupt change in thepattern of pixel intensities. The edge of an object representsthe object\u2019s general shape or contour and therefore aids inidentifying that object. This idea that an object\u2019s edges maycontain enough information to classify an image, is what ledus to investigate if encoding the edges of an image instead ofthe image itself would lead to a reduction in spikes in spiketrains.From here, we implemented a Python program which em-ploys the OpenCV Canny edge detection to \ufb01nd the edgesof the MNIST handwritten digit dataset [13]. Canny edgedetection consists of four different image processing steps:(1) Gaussian Filter, (2) Sobel Filters, (3) Non-maximumSuppression, and (4) Hysteresis Thresholding.The \ufb01rst two steps in the Canny edge detection processinvolve applying two \ufb01lters to the image using convolution.Convolution allows neighboring pixels around a central inputpixel to be weighted and then summed up to determine theintensity of the central output pixel in the same location asthe input pixel. In the case of Canny edge detection, a 5x5Gaussian \ufb01lter is \ufb01rst applied to smoothen the image andreduce the image noise [13].The Sobel \ufb01lter is then applied to the smoothened imageto get a preliminary edge detected image. Applying the Sobel\ufb01lter computes the \ufb01rst derivative in both the horizontal andvertical directions which corresponds to two output images.These two output images, horizontal and vertical, are thenused to \ufb01nd the edge gradient and the direction of the lineperpendicular to the tangent line of the edge [13]. The resultis an image which has pixels with higher intensities roughlywhere the edges were located.While the resulting image from applying the Sobel \ufb01lterprocess gives us the edges of the image, these edges arenot ideal and the number of edge pixels are not minimized.This is not ideal because we wish to minimize the number ofpixels that represent the edges so that the signal length andconsequently spike train length is minimized. The next stepsin Canny edge detection aid in minimizing the edge pixels.In the third step, a non-maximum suppression algorithm isused to suppress certain pixels that are not actually part of anedge. The algorithm looks at the pixels in the output of thesecond step and then, using the direction from the second step,analyzes the pixel and its surrounding pixels to determine ifit is on the edge. If the pixel is determined to not be on theedge, then its intensity is set to zero [13].The \ufb01nal step in the Canny edge detection is to use hys-teresis thresholding to eliminate any remaining pixels whichare not actual edge pixels and output an image with semi-connected thin edges. The algorithm, speci\ufb01cally, looks forpixels which have intensities higher than a given threshold anddetermines them as edge pixels. If the pixel has an intensitysmaller than a given lower threshold, then it is determinedto not be on the edge. Finally, if the pixel is between theupper and lower intensity thresholds, then pixel is determinedto be on the edge if and only if it is connected to an alreadydetermined edge pixel [13].2--- Page 3 ---After applying the Canny edge detection process, the edgesof the original image in Figure 1 (a) are detected and Figure1 (b) is generated. Figure 1 (b) is then passed into Algorithm1 to extract the X and Y coordinates of the edge pixels inthe image and create the X and Y signals which will be laterencoded into spike trains. As shown in Figure 1 (c) and (d),there is a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the length of the X and Ysignals obtained from the edge image compared to those ofthe original raw image. In particular, for a random sample of1000 MNIST digits, i.e. 100 samples of each digit 0 through9, there is a 41.7% reduction in the length of the signal foredge images compared to the original images.Algorithm 2: Temporal Encoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: s signal, SamplingThreshold ,EncodingThresholdOutput: out, startpoint, count1: count = zeros(length(s) \u22121)2: for t = 0to length(s) \u22121 do3: count[t] =ceil(abs((s[t + 1]\u2212s[t])/SamplingThreshold ))4: sa = zeros(sum(count) + 1)5: n = 06: for i = 0to length(s) \u22121 do7: for j = 0to count[t] do8: sa[n] =s[i] + (j)/count[t] \u2217(s[i + 1]\u2212s[i])9: n + = 110: sa[length(sa) \u22121] =s[length(s) \u22121]11: out, startpoint =TemporalEncoding(sa, EncodingThreshold, ...)Algorithm 3: Temporal Decoding with Adaptive Sam-plingInput: spikes, EncodingThreshold , startpoint,countOutput: recon1: recona =Decoding(spikes, EncodingThreshold,startpoint)2: m = 03: recon = zeros(length(count) + 1)4: for t = 0to length(count) do5: recon [t] =recona[m]6: m + =count[t]7: recon[length(recon)\u22121] =recona[length(recona)\u22121]III. A DAPTIVE TEMPORAL ENCODINGOnce the static images are converted to signals, as describedin the previous section, temporal encoding mechanisms can beused to generate spike trains from the produced signals. In thisstep, selection and optimization of temporal encoding methodsplay an important role to achieve a high precision signal-to-spike train conversion. In our initial experiments, we used theknown step-forward (SF) encoding [9] method to encode theX and Y signals obtained from edge detection. However, wenoticed that using a \ufb01xed sampling rate to encode the signalwill lead to either an overestimation (with high sampling rate)or an underestimation (with low sampling rate), which leads tohigh computation cost or low encoding precision, respectively.Thus, in this work, we propose an adaptive sampling approach,which works as a preprocessing step for temporal encodingmechanisms.The objective of the adaptive sampling is to increase thesampling rate when there are abrupt changes to the signaland reduce the sampling rate when the signal exhibits moregradual variations. The adaptive sampling algorithm for tem-poral encoding is presented in Algorithm 2. The algorithm\ufb01rst samples the signal with \ufb01xed intervals and then calculateshow many more samples, (count in Algorithm 2), are requiredbetween two consecutive points based on the change in signalbetween the two points. Next, the signal is sampled again, thistime based on the number of samples calculated in the previousstep, inserting more points for higher signal resolution basedon the rate of change. Finally, the adaptively-sampled signalis converted to a spike train using any temporal encodingmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR), SF,etc. [9], as shown in line 11 of the Algorithm 2.The adaptive sampling approach includes a sampling thresh-old which de\ufb01nes the sensitivity of the algorithm to changesin the signal. The lower the threshold value is, the moresamples will be taken (Line 3 of the Algorithm 2) between twoconsecutive points. This adaptive sampling thus optimizes theaverage \ufb01ring rate (AFR) to be seen in section IV for minimalspikes in the resulting spike trains without compromisingaccuracy.Decoding the spike trains generated by adaptive sampling-based temporal encoding approaches requires a post-processing step that is described in Algorithm 3. Once thespike trains are decoded using normal decoding methods forspike trains [9] (Line 1 of Algorithm 3), the sample countsstored in the count array during the adaptive sampling willbe used to reconstruct the original signal. Here, without lossof generality, we used the adaptive sampling approach alongwith SF and TBR methods to develop an adaptive temporalspike encoding mechanism for static images. The TBR andSF encoding algorithms and their corresponding decodingalgorithm is provided in Appendix A.IV. S IMULATION RESULTSIn this section, we evaluate our adaptive temporal encodingapproach by using MNIST handwritten digits [12] as represen-tative static images, convert them to signals, encode the signalinto spike trains, reconstruct the signals and compare themwith original signals using various indicator and error metrics.For samples of complete encoding-to-reconstruction process3--- Page 4 ---Fig. 2: Performance metrics for adaptive SF encoding using various threshold values.

We use root mean square error (RMSE)and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metrics to assess the precisionof the encoding approaches. SNR is de\ufb01ned asSNR = 20\xb7log Power (s)Power (s \u2212r)[dB] (1)where s is the original signal, r is the reconstructed signal,and Power is calculated asPower (s) = 1/NN\u22121\u2211k=0|s(k)|2 (2)4--- Page 5 ---where N is the number of samples. RMSE is de\ufb01ned asRMSE =\u221a\u2211Nt=1(st \u2212rt)2N (3)On the other hand, average \ufb01ring rate (AFR) and spike countmetrics are utilized to evaluate the computational ef\ufb01ciencyof encoding methods. AFR indicates how saturated the spiketrain is and is de\ufb01ned asAFR =\u2211Nt |spt|N (4)where sp is the number of all spikes in a given spike train [9].Here, the objective is increasing the SNR while decreasingRMSE, AFR and spike count. Figures 2 and 3 exhibit theperformance metrics for the adaptive and edge detected SF andTBR encoding experiments, respectively, with encoding andsampling thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 with 0.1 intervals.B. Threshold OptimizationTo co-optimize the sampling threshold in the adaptivesampling algorithm and encoding threshold in the temporal en-coding mechanisms (see Appendix A), we introduce a Fitnessfunction that combines several of the aforementioned metrics,as expressed in (5). The higher Fitness value represents betterreconstruction.Fitness = SNRRMSE \xd7SpikeCount (5)Figure 4 shows the reconstruction \ufb01tness of the adaptiveSF and TBR encoding methods for various sampling andencoding thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 2.0. The maximum\ufb01tness values for adaptive SF and TBR encoding methods areachieved at ( SamplingThreshold, EncodingThreshold) equals(0.1, 0.2) for SF and (1.0, 0.9) for TBR, respectively. Bycontrast, the optimal EncodingThreshold for non-adaptivelysampled experiments are 2.0 (X) and 1.2 (Y) for SF and2.0 (X) and 0.9 (Y) for TBR. Table I provides a comparisonbetween adaptive SF and TBR encoding with the optimizedthreshold values mentioned above. As listed in the table, TBRis more ef\ufb01cient in terms of spike count, but the SF exhibitsa greater SNR and smaller RMSE making it more desireablefor precise reconstuction. It should be noted, however, thatthe average number of spikes is greatly increased due to theadaptive sampling increasing the resolution of the signal. It isworth noting that the \ufb01tness function can be adjusted, usingm and n parameters in (6), based on the speci\ufb01c applicationrequirement to emphasize on the precision or computationef\ufb01ciency:Fitness(m, n) = SNRRMSE (m) \xd7SpikeCount (n) (6)As can be seen in table I, the lowest RMSE values occurin the experiments where adaptive sampling was used versuswithout adaptive sampling. The average number of spikes in allcases where edge detection was used does marginally reducethe number of spikes.Fig. 4: Fitness plots. (a)-(b) The X signal.

C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKIn this paper, we proposed an adaptive temporal encodingmethod to convert the static images into spike trains. Theproposed encoding approach aims to allow static images tobe processed by SNNs with smaller networks, using only twoinputs x and y. However, when it comes to temporal encoding,the encoding precision becomes very important. Therefore, weperformed intensive simulations to evaluate and optimize ourproposed encoding approach. We introduced a novel \ufb01tnessfunction which combines the accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency metricsto optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed adaptive tem-poral encoding. The results obtained exhibit an accurate spikeencoding of MNIST handwritten digits as representative staticimages. Future work includes evaluating the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach for the whole SNN application through5--- Page 6 ---implementing it on neuromorphic hardware, e.g. Loihi [14],for image classi\ufb01cation application on a variety of datasets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work is partially supported by an ASPIRE grant fromthe Of\ufb01ce of the Vice President for Research at the Universityof South Carolina.REFERENCES[1] A.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #18, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #3, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device real-time image classification optimization\n```\nStep #4, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device real-time image classification optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered.

However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #19, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s).

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\nPublication Date: 2014-01-30\narXiv paper ID: 1401.7743v1\n\nTitle: Structure Tensor Based Image Interpolation Method\nSummary: Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing\nfield. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution\nalgorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian\nfilter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and\nthe pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners\nand edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to\napplication of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to\nnoise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure\ntensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the\nedges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation\nmethods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and\nobjective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in\ncase of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for\noptimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.\nPublication Date: 2014-02-22\narXiv paper ID: 1402.5564v3\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images.

Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges.

Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered.

However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs.

On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #20, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: ```EXPIRATION 3\n--- Page 1 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layerand Block Pruning with Latency ConstraintXinglong Sun1,2\u22c6, Barath Lakshmanan1, Maying Shen1, Shiyi Lan1, JingdeChen1, and Jose Alvarez11 NVIDIA2 Stanford University{xinglongs, blakshmanan, mshen, shiyil, joshchen, josea}@nvidia.com2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1EagleEye (ECCV'20)MetaPruning (ICCV'19)AutoSlim (NeurIPS'19)0.50 x ResNet50ResNet18HALP (NeurIPS'22)SMCP (ECCV'22)Ours+4.2Top1+ 426FPS+ 1161 FPS +2.1mAP+5.6 FPSFig. 1:MDP exhibits Pareto dominance across different tasks.

In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-artby pruning StreamPETR [60] at a45% pruning ratio, achieving higherFPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.Keywords: Network Pruning, Model Acceleration, MINLP.1 IntroductionDeep neural networks have become the de-facto standards of advanced com-puter vision applications, ranging from image classification [25] to object de-tection [43] and segmentation [46]. Contemporary networks [15,60,65] usuallyconsist of both convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractorsand transformer blocks to capture global cues. As the performance advances,the models swell in size correspondingly, containing millions or even billions ofparameters [33]. This growth in model size presents challenges for deploymenton resource-constrained edge devices, hinders real-time inference tasks such asautonomous driving, and incurs significant costs for training and inference oncloud systems. Pruning [23,50,54], which involves removing redundant parame-ters from the network, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the modelcomputation and size to reach real-time requirements without significantly com-promising its accuracy. To keep pace with the ever-expanding model sizes, weneed very aggressive pruningtechniques to significantly reduce latency for effi-cient and real-time model deployment.Channel pruning [31,38,39,50,52\u201354,59], in particular, has garnered signif-icant attention as an effective pruning technique to reduce model computation,usually 30% - 50%, practically without requiring changes in the hardware. Chan-nel pruning involves removing redundant convolution filters identified by someimportance criterion [39,40,50], usually starting from a pre-trained model. De-spite advancements, these methods have two critical limitations. First, channelpruning methods are confined to pruning on the channel level, while we cannot avoid the structural removal of entire blocks or layers to achieve the largerpruning ratios required (70%-90%). Only a few works [11,19,58,61,62,64] ad-dress layer or block pruning. These methods can provide greater accelerationthan channel pruning, but they are restricted to pruning at the layer or blockgranularity and cannot simultaneously introduce channel sparsity, resulting insuboptimal accuracy.Second, current pruning approaches to directly reduce inference latency uselatency models that only account for variations in output channel count at eachlayer, ignoring the simultaneous impact of pruning on input channels [10,13,31,34,49,52,54,66]. This inaccurate latency estimation leads to sub-optimaltrade-offs between accuracy and latency, especially at the larger pruning ratiosrequired for inference on the edge. With large pruning ratios, guiding pruningtoward an optimal structure becomes more challenging while adhering closely tothe desired latency without precise modeling.--- Page 3 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 3INPUTCONV + RELUPOOLING2x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 1BlockDecisionVariableLayerChannel Variable1 \U0001d49a\U0001d7cf1\U0001d467"\u2208{0,1} 2 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d03 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d12\U0001d467%\u2208{0,1}4 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d25 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d36 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d4\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u20260.040.070.120.170.080.110.180.20.110.150.210.230.160.190.240.280.180.240.290.32latency cost matrixMINLP Solver layerschannelsExtract Pruned Subnetwork3x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 2\u2026Pretrained Model\u201ccat\u201d\u0398\U0001d458\U0001d458\U0001d48e\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7d2\U0001d48e\U0001d7d0=\U0001d7d3Zoomed-in Layer 3\u0398!\u2208\U0001d445"\xd7$\xd7%\xd7%0.91.30.20.5ChannelImportance0.91.30.20.5Sorting1.32.22.72.9LayerImportanceCompute Layer ImportanceScore every possible channel count$\U0001d43c!Output Channel Count Input Channel Count \U0001d436!Compute LatencyCapture both in. and out. dims. changesBlock Grouping\U0001d466+,=1\U0001d466--=1\U0001d466.,\U0001d466/,\U0001d4660:\U0001d45b/\U0001d44e\U0001d466,+=1argmax\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5(\U0001d466!'\u22c5$\U0001d43c!)+\u2026s.t.\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5\U0001d466!\u22c5\U0001d466('\u22c5\U0001d436!+\u22ef\u2264\u03a8MINLP Formulation w/Latency and Importance Expression of Layer 3\U0001d467,=1 \U0001d467+=0 blocksFinetuningTopK&SumOne-hot Vector0 10 0Eg.\U0001d49a\U0001d7d1\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7cf: Keep 3Output Channels at Layer 3Fig. 2:Paradigm of our proposed method MDP. We start by computing layer im-portance and constructing latency cost matrices for each layer. We then group layerswithin the same block and solve an MINLP to optimize pruning decisions at bothchannel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnetwork and finetune it.This paper presents a novel pruning framework that effectively overcomes thelimitations of existing methods. Specifically, we do not model channels or layersseparately. Instead, we first group channels and layers within the same block inour formulation, allowing them to be handled jointly in the optimization process.This unified approach seamlessly integrates channel, layer, and block pruning,enabling us to identify the optimal pruned structure at all levels efficiently. Sec-ond, for accurate modeling of latency in different configurations at each layer,we propose the concept ofbilayer configuration latency, which considers simul-taneous variations in both input and output channel counts across all layers.To incorporate these two strategies, we reformulate pruning as a Mixed-IntegerNonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]. This allows us to directly solve for theoptimal pruned structure adhering to a specific latency budget with only a singlepass. As a result, our framework enhances pruning performance with significantlatency reductions. All together, we refer to our method asMulti-DimensionalPruning (MDP).Our code will be provided upon acceptance.Our extensive experiments, with a glimpse showcased in Figure 1, validateour method\u2019s superior performance, particularlyat high pruning ratios.

At a largerpruning ratio of70%, we significantly outpace HALP [54] in both FPS (43.3 vs.42.5) and mAP (0.394 vs. 0.373).

Exemplary channel importance criterionrelied on metrics like weight norm [14,26,27,39,67], Taylor expansion [41,50,68],geometric median [28], and feature maps rank [40]. Our method leverages theTaylor [50] channel importance criterion but extend it to evaluate the configu-rations of entire layers and blocks, going beyond just pruning channel but alsocombining layer and block removals.Layer and Block PruningChannel pruning methods have been effective inreducing performance loss while removing a moderate number of parameters.However, their effectiveness is limited when it comes to more extensive pruning.This is because they focus only on removing channels, but to achieve optimalresults with significant pruning, it becomes necessary to remove entire layers orblocks. Only a limited number of works [11,19,58,61,62,64] focus on pruninglayers and blocks. [12] and [19] employ intermediate features at each layer tocompute a layer ranking score with linear classifier probes [12] or imprinting [19]and remove the lowest ranked layers. [61] introduces linear classifier probe aftereach block to check performance and remove blocks with the smallest improve-ments from the previous. Recent method [62] also studies individually removingeach block and calculating importance based on the performance drop.Though shown to provide larger speedups than channel pruning, all of theseapproaches [11,19,58,61,62,64] only operate at the layer or block granularityand fail if we want to introduce channel sparsity simultaneously. Additionally,some add extra module or parameters like linear probes [12,61] that requireadditional training and complicate the process. Our methodseamlessly uniteschannel and block pruning, which allows us to efficiently determine an optimalpruned structure at both the channel and block levels with just a single pass onthe pre-trained model, without any need for extra training or parameters.--- Page 5 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 5Hardware-aware Pruning Since parameter compression ratio does not di-rectly translate into computation reduction ratio, some works [38,63,67] focusprimarily on reducing model FLOPs. Latest methods go one step further andperform hardware-aware pruning which aims to directly reduce the hardwareinference latency. The representative work HALP [54] first prepares a latencylookup table for all configurations of prunable parameters measured on the tar-get hardware then formulate pruning as a knapsack problem [55], maximizingtotal parameter importance while constraining the total associated latency un-der a given budget. [52] later demonstrates that HALP can be applied to au-tonomous systems to achieve real-time detection performance. To enhance thelearning capacity of pruned models, SMCP [31] introduces soft masking withinthe HALP framework, enabling the reconsideration of earlier pruned weights inan iterative pruning setting.Although these methods [31,52,54] have made notable progress in accuracyand speed, their reliance on an inaccurate latency estimation leads to subopti-mal accuracy-latency trade-offs. They account for changes in output channelsbut overlook simultaneous variations in input channels caused by pruning thepreceding layer. This issue is more pronounced when aiming for large latencyreductions, as it becomes more challenging to guide pruning to meet the desiredlatency budget without accurate latency modeling. In our work, we also focuson hardware-aware pruningbut introduce a more accurate latency modeling tech-nique that accounts for simultaneous variations in both input and output channelcounts across all layers, allowing us to determine optimal configurations globally.Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]As our strategiesof block pruning and accurate latency modeling are unified with a MINLP for-mulation, we will briefly introduce the field. Formally defined in [37], MINLPsare optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables, where theobjective and constraints are nonlinear functions. Effectively and efficiently solv-ing MINLP [3\u20135,17,18,21,22] is a critical area in optimization research, with keycomponent often involving decomposing the problem into Mixed-Integer LinearPrograms (MILP) and Nonlinear Programs (NLP). Recently, conveniently mod-eling and solving MINLPs in Python has been made possible with Pyomo [8]and MindtPy [2]. In this paper, we use the Outer Approximation (OA) [17,21]method with Pyomo [8] and MindtPy [2] to solve our pruning MINLP.3 MethodologyWe will now present our pruning framework. We begin by establishing prelimi-naries, defining our goals and declaring relevant notations. We then describe ourproposed pruning formulation in detail.PreliminariesFortheneuralnetworkwith L convolutionlayersintotal,werep-resent the convolution parameters as\u0398 = SLl=1 \u0398l, s.t.\u0398l \u2208 Rml\xd7ml\u22121\xd7Kl\xd7Kl ,where ml, ml\u22121, Kl denote the number of output channels, input channels, andkernel size at layerl respectively. Following [25,47], a block is defined as the setof layers(e.g. bottleneck [25]) skipped by a residual connection. Suppose there is--- Page 6 ---6 X.Sun et al.a total ofB blocks in the network\u0398. Given a desired inference latency,\u03a8, ourgoal is to find the most performant subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 \u2286 \u0398 through pruning, suchthat the inference latency of\u02c6\u0398 is below the budget\u03a8 on the target hardware.Additionally, we declare the following entities(all1-indexed):Name Notation Explanationlayer2block \u03b2(l) \u2208 [1, B] map layerl to ID of the block it belongs tolayer channel variableyl \u2208 {0,1}ml , one-hotyil = 1if layerl keepsi out ofml channelsblock decision variablezb \u2208 {0,1}, b\u2208 [1, B] zb = 0if the entirebth block is prunedTo elaborate, the layer channel variablesyl is defined as one-hot vector,where the index of the hot bit representsthe total numberof selected channelsin the pruned network\u02c6\u0398, ranging from1 to ml. If thebth block is pruned (i.e.zb = 0), all layers in this block(\u03b2(l) =b) are removed, regardless of the value ofyl. In this case, the channel count becomes0.The layer channel variablesy and block decision variablesz describe thepruning decisions and encode the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398, and they are our targetsto jointly optimize. In the following sections, we will describe how to solve thembased on information we collected from the pre-trained network\u0398.3.1 Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP)To understand how performant a pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 is, following previousworks [31,39,40,50,54], we leverage importance score as a proxy. The optimalsubnetwork \u02c6\u0398 is considered to be the one that maximizes the importance scorewhile closely adhering to the latency constraint\u03a8. With large latency reductionfrom the original model\u0398, we need to consider potential removal of layers andblocks while guiding the pruning decisions with accurate latency estimations.To identify this optimal subnetwork encoded by layer channel variables (y) andblock decision variables (z), we begin by defining two key components, the im-portance score for different values ofy and z and accurate latency estimationfor these varying configurations, for each individual layer. The final objective isthe aggregation of these components across all layers of the model.Next, to seamlessly combine complete layer and block removal with channelsparsity, we perform ablock groupingstep which groups the latency and impor-tance expression for all layers within the same block under a single block decisionvariable. We then formulate the above as aMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program-ming (MINLP)to jointly determiney and z for an optimal pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 at both the channel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnet-work structure \u02c6\u0398 from the solver\u2019s output ofy and z and carry out a finetuningsession on \u02c6\u0398 for E epochs to recover the accuracy. All together, we refer to ourmethod as Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP). A paradigm diagram of MDPis demonstrated in Fig. 2. We are now going to describe the details of each step.Layer Importance ComputationAs discussed in Sec.2, the quality of thepruned subnetworks could be conveniently assessed with channel importance--- Page 7 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 7scores. With Taylor importance score [50], the importance of thejth channel atlayer l can be computed as:Ijl = |g\u03b3jl\u03b3jl + g\u03b2jl\u03b2jl |, (1)where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are BatchNorm layer\u2019s weight and bias for the correspondingchannel, andg\u03b3 and g\u03b2 are the gradients.As the number of channels kept in a layerl is directly encoded by the one-hot variablesyl, we associate an importance score for each possible configurationyl could take, with the one-hot bit index ranging from1 to ml. We leverage agreedy approach to derive this. For example, if at layerl pruning keepsi channels(i.e. yil = 1), we would like thesei channels to be the top-i most important.Therefore, we first rank individual channel importance scoresIl at layer l inascending order. Then to compute layer importance score\u02c6Iil corresponding toyl with yil = 1, we aggregate thei highest channel importance scores.Formally, this is expressed as:\u02c6Iil =XTop-i(Il), \u2200i \u2208 [1, ml] (2)The vector\u02c6Il \u2208 Rml fully describes the importance scores for all possible numberof channels layerl could take from1 to ml. We thereby define theimportance atlayer l for a specific configurationyl as a simple dot-product:yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il.Latency ModelingIn order to accurately guide our pruning, we fully describethe latency variations with respect to both the number of its output and inputchannels and construct a latency cost matrixCl for each convolution layerl asfollows:Cl =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0Tl(1, 1) Tl(1, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(1, ml)Tl(2, 1) Tl(2, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(2, ml)...... ... ...Tl(ml\u22121, 1) Tl(ml\u22121, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(ml\u22121, ml)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (3)Here, Tl is a pre-built latency lookup table, which could be measured on thetarget hardware beforehand as prior works [31,52,54], andTl(i, j) returns thelatency of layerl with i input channels andj output channels, upper-bounded bythe total channel countml\u22121 and ml in \u0398. Cl enumerates latency correspondingtoallpossibilitieslayer l couldbe,varyingtheinputandoutputchannelnumbers.With these configurations encoded in the one-hot layer channel variablesyl\u22121and yl, we define thebilayer configuration latencyat layerl for specificyl\u22121 andyl simply as two dot-products:yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl).We can observe that eachyl appears twice in the expressions, once at com-puting latency for layerl, and once at layerl+1. While this poses some challengesin optimization, it manages to accurately capture the full overall latency land-scape of network. This approach enables us to guide the pruning process withmore precise latency estimations, significantly improving the precision from pre-vious methods [31,52,54] that did not consider the simultaneous contributionsfrom both output and input channel dimension.--- Page 8 ---8 X.Sun et al.Block GroupingNotice that we define the layer channel variablesyl to onlydescribechannelcountfrom 1 toml,excludingthecasewhenpruningremovesallchannels from layerl(i.e. channel count of0). This means if we only use variablesy to represent the pruned model\u02c6\u0398, we cannot represent completely removinga layer from the network; at best, we can reduce it to just one channel, similarto previous methods [31,52,54]. This is intentional because arbitrarily pruninga single layer could easily lead to network disconnection, causing discontinuityin the information flow of the network. However, residual blocks are inherentlyresilient to removal of all their internal layers at once, as the skip connectionallows information to bypass the removed layers, preserving gradient flow.To handle the removal of an entire residual block structure, we introduceblock grouping where layers are grouped into the block it belongs to. Specifically,we parse the network architecture to obtain thelayer2block mapping \u03b2(l) forevery layerl. Then we group all importance and latency expressions within thesame block under a single block decision variable. If pruning decides to removethe bth block, the importance and latency contributions from all layers withinthat block, where\u03b2(l) =b, should be simultaneously set to0.We model this group decision with the binary block decision variableszb.Subsequently, for each layerl, we first determine whether its associated blockdecision variable, denoted byz\u03b2(l), is active (z\u03b2(l) = 1). Only if it is active, weevaluate the layer importance and latency expressions determined byy; other-wise, they are simply zeroed. Theimportancefor layerl is determined by bothyland z\u03b2(l), and can be expressed asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il). Similarly, thebilayer configu-ration latencyat convolution layerl can be represented asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\xb7(yl\u22121\u22a4\xb7Cl)).Block removal is properly handled by giving the block decision variableszshigher \u2019priority\u2019 than the layer channel variablesys. For example, deactivatingz1 results in the exclusion of all layers within the first block(where\u03b2(l) = 1) bysimultaneously setting their importance and latency expressions to0, regardlessof the values taken by theiryls. Also, notice that for thelayers that do not belongto any block structures, their correspondingzs are simply always1.Solve MINLPWe aim to jointly determine the optimal layer channel and blockdecisions(y andz)thatmaximizethesummationoftheir importance scoreswhileensuring the cumulativebilayer configuration latencyremains below the budget\u03a8. Formally, this can be represented with the following Mixed-Integer NonlinearProgramming (MINLP) formulation:arg maxy,zLXl=1z\u03b2(l) \xb7 (yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il) (4)s.t.LXl=1z\u03b2(l)\xb7(yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl)) \u2264 \u03a8We restrict all decision variablesy and z to binary values, while the layerimportances \u02c6Il and latency cost matricesCl contain floating-point numbers,hence making the program mixed-integer in nature.

Since we jointly optimize all variables, we candirectly determine a globally optimal set ofy and z with only a single pass.Extract Pruned StructureOnce we solved the MINLP program 4, we proceedto extract the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 based on the variablesy and z determinedby the solver. If block decision variablezb is set to0 for a particular blockb,we completely remove that block in\u02c6\u0398 and disregard the solver\u2019s output for thelayer channel variables(yl) of the layers within that block (where\u03b2(l) =b). Onthe other hand, if the block is active withzb = 1and the solver returns the valueof y with yil = 1, we keepi channels in \u02c6\u0398 at layerl according to ArgTopK(Il, i),mapping layer importance\u02c6Il in Eqn.2 back to thei top-performing channels.In practice, since the layer importances\u02c6I are built from Taylor score [50] mea-sured using gradient information from data batches, we perform pruning afterone epoch when the model has seen all of the samples in the dataset and accumu-late their importance estimation. After pruning, we finetune the pruned model\u02c6\u0398 for a duration ofE epochs to recover accuracy. An algorithmic description ofthe above process is provided in Algorithm 1.--- Page 10 ---10 X.Sun et al.4 ExperimentsTo validate the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments across acomprehensive set of scenarios. We demonstrate our pruning results on 3 tasks:image classification with ImageNet [16] and ResNet50 [25], 2D object detectionwith Pascal VOC [20] and SSD [43], and 3D object detection with Nuscenes [9]and StreamPETR [60].Our method improves upon previous approaches by providing(a)more accu-rate latency estimation and(b) the ability to handle the removal of entire layerand block structures. These improvements are reflected in our superior result,as we achieve a new state-of-the-art with a significantly better accuracy-latencytrade-off compared to prior arts [31,54] and other competitive baselines [38,59],especially at higher pruning ratios. To provide a comprehensive understanding ofour proposed pruning framework, we also conducted an in-depth ablation study,highlighting the individual contribution of our improvement from(a) and (b).Settings For ResNet50 and SSD, we aimed to optimize their inference latencyon the Nvidia TITAN V GPU with batch size of256. When pruning Stream-PETR [60], we adapted our approach to target the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090GPU batch size of1, aligning with the focus of StreamPETR\u2019s original paper.This allowed us to fairly evaluate the speedup benefits and also demonstrate thegeneralization of our method targeting different hardware platforms.All of our trainings use 8 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs and conducted withPyTorch [51] V1.4.0. Our CPU is Intel Xeon E5-2698 and is used to solve theMINLP optimization(Eqn. 4).4.1 Classification Results on ImageNetIn Table 1, We report our pruning results and comparison with the baselinemethods on ResNet50 [25] and ImageNet [16]. We evaluate these results usingTop-1 Accuracy and Top-5 Accuracy to gauge the recovered accuracy after fine-tuning. In addition, we include inference FPS (im/s, i.e. images per second) todirectly showcase the speedups on the target hardware. We also present FLOPsfor completeness.Compared with previous methods like HALP [54] and SMCP [31], we achievea significantly improved accuracy-latency trade-off. For instance, SMCP reachesa Top-1 accuracy of 72.7 with an inference speed of 3784 im/s; our methodslightly surpasses its Top-1 with an accuracy of72.8 but with a considerablyfaster inference speed of 4210 im/s. With larger pruning, HALP achieves aTop-1 accuracy of68.6 with an inference speed of4101 im/s, our method signif-icantly outperforms it with a Top-1 accuracy of70.0 and an impressive FPS of5262 im/s. Notably, we can observe from Table 1 that our method particularlyexcels when targeting high FPS with substantial pruning from pre-trainedmodels, corroborating the effectiveness of improvements from our method. Ourimprovements could be observed more clearly in the FPS v.s.

Our perfor-mance is assessed against various competitive baselines, including HALP [54]and SMCP [31]. We depict the Pareto frontier, showcasing the trade-off betweenFPS and mean Average Precision (mAP).Our results distinctly outshine existing methods in the field, marking a sub-stantial advancement.

In this section, we explore our pruning effectivenessfor these hybrid models. We focus on the challenging task of 3D object detection,using the widely recognized Nuscenes [9] dataset and the state-of-the-art modelStreamPETR [60], composed of a heavy CNN-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. Our analysis of the system\u2019s latency revealed that the CNN-basedencoder has a higher latency (16.7ms) than the transformer decoder (14ms).This indicates that applying our method to the convolutional layers can stilleffectively accelerate the entire network.Detailed results and comparisons with several competitive baselines are pre-sentedinTable 2.Ourevaluationincorporatedadiversesetofmetricscommonlyadopted for 3D object detection tasks [9,42,60], including the mean Average Pre-cision (mAP) and Normalized Detection Score (NDS). Additionally, we reportthe FPS to highlight the improvements in speed.Significantly, when compared to the dense pre-trained StreamPETR model,our technique achieved a substantial acceleration of approximately18%, result-ing in an impressive37.3 FPS as opposed to the baseline\u2019s31.7 FPS. Impor-tantly,thisspeedboostwasachievedwithoutsacrificingperformance:ourprunedmodel attained superior mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) and NDS (0.551 vs. 0.546). Incomparison to the previous pruning method HALP [54], our approach exhibitedremarkable improvements in accuracy-latency trade-offs across various pruningratios. For instance, HALP managed to produce a pruned StreamPETR modelwith an mAP of0.373, an NDS of0.489, and an inference FPS of42.5. In con-trast, our approach surpassed these results, achieving an mAP of0.394, an NDSof 0.512, and an inference FPS of43.3.4.4 Ablation Study4.4.1 As discussed in detail in Sec. 3.1, our pruning method introduces twokey improvements from prior methods: (a)\u201cbilayer configuration latency" foraccurate latency modeling;(b)"block grouping" for integration of block removalwith channel sparsity.We\u2019ll now explore the individual impacts of(a) and (b) on pruning perfor-mance. Thebaseline here is thus a bare latency pruning algorithm without both(a) and (b). We then ablate each component by separately adding them on topof the baseline to check inidividual improvement. The baseline performance isdepicted in Fig. 4 with label \u201cBaseline".Bilayer Configuration LatencyIn this setting, we add our \u201cbilayer configura-tion latency" on top of the baseline but drop theblock groupingstep to excludethe block decision variables from the MINLP program 4. This variant accuratelyestimates the latency impacts of pruning by considering variations in both inputand output channel counts, but it cannot handle removal of entire blocks. Theresult, labeled \u201cOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)" in Fig. 4, show a markedly betteraccuracy-latency tradeoff than the baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness evenwhen used alone.--- Page 14 ---14 X.Sun et al.2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1BaselineOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)Ours(Only Block Grouping)OursFig. 4: Ablation study results on Ima-geNet with ResNet50.

We show re-sults of ours and HALP [54] with differentpruning steps.Block GroupingIn this setting, we add our \u201cblock grouping" step to the base-line but do not use our \u201cbilayer configuration latency" to model latency impactsfrom pruning. Instead, we use previous methods\u2019 latency modeling [31,52,54],which only account for variations in output channel counts. This variant caneffectively handle the removal of block strucutres to accommodate high pruningratiosbutbutcannotaccuratelyestimatelatencyimpactsbyconsideringchangesin both input and output channel counts. The results, labeled \u201cOurs(Only BlockGrouping)" in Fig. 4, show an evidently improved accuracy-latency tradeoff com-pared to the baseline, particularly at large pruning ratios and latency reduc-tion(rightmost points in the curves). This indicates the effectiveness of "blockgrouping" even when used independently.4.4.2 By integrating our above two strategies into a unified MINLP frame-work, we enable efficient and single-pass pruning.Single-passv.s.IterativePruning Oursingle-passpruningapproachachievesthe target latency in just one step, while iterative methods like HALP [54] re-quire up to 30 steps. Performance comparisons between our method and HALPacross different pruning steps are shown in Table 3.As observed, our approach performs consistently well regardless of the prun-ing steps. Our single-pass performance is even better than our 30-steps iterativepruning. We believe this is likely due to the benefit of using importance scoresfrom all samples in the dataset at once.In contrast, HALP\u2019s performance worsens with fewer pruning steps, espe-cially in single-pass pruning where it defies the latency budget and over-prunes,leading to a Top-1 of65.1 and FPS of4444. This behavior is because the over-sights of (a) and (b) can be somewhat mitigated with multiple pruning steps,but become more pronounced with just one or fewer steps.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce a novel pruning framework called MDP that inte-grates channel, layer, and block pruning within a unified optimization processand develop an accurate latency modeling technique that captures simultane-ous input and output channel variations. To incorporate these strategies, we--- Page 15 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 15reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to effi-ciently identify the optimal pruned structure within a specific latency budgetin a single pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over pre-vious methods, especially in scenarios requiring large pruning. We also pro-vide an in-depth ablation study to investigate each contribution individually.References1.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #6, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nneural architecture search edge devices image classification\n```\nStep #7, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query neural architecture search edge devices image classification, here was the response\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations. Our resulting architecture outperforms MLPerf MobileNetV1\nby 6.3% accuracy improvement with 3.5x less number of parameters on Visual Wake\nWords.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-08\narXiv paper ID: 2303.04440v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2307.04443v1\n```\nStep #9, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2307.04443v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification latency optimization\n```\nStep #10, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification latency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #20, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layerand Block Pruning with Latency ConstraintXinglong Sun1,2\u22c6, Barath Lakshmanan1, Maying Shen1, Shiyi Lan1, JingdeChen1, and Jose Alvarez11 NVIDIA2 Stanford University{xinglongs, blakshmanan, mshen, shiyil, joshchen, josea}@nvidia.com2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1EagleEye (ECCV'20)MetaPruning (ICCV'19)AutoSlim (NeurIPS'19)0.50 x ResNet50ResNet18HALP (NeurIPS'22)SMCP (ECCV'22)Ours+4.2Top1+ 426FPS+ 1161 FPS +2.1mAP+5.6 FPSFig. 1:MDP exhibits Pareto dominance across different tasks.

Contemporary networks [15,60,65] usuallyconsist of both convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractorsand transformer blocks to capture global cues. As the performance advances,the models swell in size correspondingly, containing millions or even billions ofparameters [33]. This growth in model size presents challenges for deploymenton resource-constrained edge devices, hinders real-time inference tasks such asautonomous driving, and incurs significant costs for training and inference oncloud systems. Pruning [23,50,54], which involves removing redundant parame-ters from the network, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the modelcomputation and size to reach real-time requirements without significantly com-promising its accuracy. To keep pace with the ever-expanding model sizes, weneed very aggressive pruningtechniques to significantly reduce latency for effi-cient and real-time model deployment.Channel pruning [31,38,39,50,52\u201354,59], in particular, has garnered signif-icant attention as an effective pruning technique to reduce model computation,usually 30% - 50%, practically without requiring changes in the hardware. Chan-nel pruning involves removing redundant convolution filters identified by someimportance criterion [39,40,50], usually starting from a pre-trained model. De-spite advancements, these methods have two critical limitations. First, channelpruning methods are confined to pruning on the channel level, while we cannot avoid the structural removal of entire blocks or layers to achieve the largerpruning ratios required (70%-90%). Only a few works [11,19,58,61,62,64] ad-dress layer or block pruning. These methods can provide greater accelerationthan channel pruning, but they are restricted to pruning at the layer or blockgranularity and cannot simultaneously introduce channel sparsity, resulting insuboptimal accuracy.Second, current pruning approaches to directly reduce inference latency uselatency models that only account for variations in output channel count at eachlayer, ignoring the simultaneous impact of pruning on input channels [10,13,31,34,49,52,54,66]. This inaccurate latency estimation leads to sub-optimaltrade-offs between accuracy and latency, especially at the larger pruning ratiosrequired for inference on the edge. With large pruning ratios, guiding pruningtoward an optimal structure becomes more challenging while adhering closely tothe desired latency without precise modeling.--- Page 3 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 3INPUTCONV + RELUPOOLING2x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 1BlockDecisionVariableLayerChannel Variable1 \U0001d49a\U0001d7cf1\U0001d467"\u2208{0,1} 2 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d03 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d12\U0001d467%\u2208{0,1}4 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d25 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d36 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d4\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u20260.040.070.120.170.080.110.180.20.110.150.210.230.160.190.240.280.180.240.290.32latency cost matrixMINLP Solver layerschannelsExtract Pruned Subnetwork3x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 2\u2026Pretrained Model\u201ccat\u201d\u0398\U0001d458\U0001d458\U0001d48e\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7d2\U0001d48e\U0001d7d0=\U0001d7d3Zoomed-in Layer 3\u0398!\u2208\U0001d445"\xd7$\xd7%\xd7%0.91.30.20.5ChannelImportance0.91.30.20.5Sorting1.32.22.72.9LayerImportanceCompute Layer ImportanceScore every possible channel count$\U0001d43c!Output Channel Count Input Channel Count \U0001d436!Compute LatencyCapture both in. and out. dims. changesBlock Grouping\U0001d466+,=1\U0001d466--=1\U0001d466.,\U0001d466/,\U0001d4660:\U0001d45b/\U0001d44e\U0001d466,+=1argmax\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5(\U0001d466!'\u22c5$\U0001d43c!)+\u2026s.t.\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5\U0001d466!\u22c5\U0001d466('\u22c5\U0001d436!+\u22ef\u2264\u03a8MINLP Formulation w/Latency and Importance Expression of Layer 3\U0001d467,=1 \U0001d467+=0 blocksFinetuningTopK&SumOne-hot Vector0 10 0Eg.\U0001d49a\U0001d7d1\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7cf: Keep 3Output Channels at Layer 3Fig. 2:Paradigm of our proposed method MDP. We start by computing layer im-portance and constructing latency cost matrices for each layer. We then group layerswithin the same block and solve an MINLP to optimize pruning decisions at bothchannel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnetwork and finetune it.This paper presents a novel pruning framework that effectively overcomes thelimitations of existing methods. Specifically, we do not model channels or layersseparately. Instead, we first group channels and layers within the same block inour formulation, allowing them to be handled jointly in the optimization process.This unified approach seamlessly integrates channel, layer, and block pruning,enabling us to identify the optimal pruned structure at all levels efficiently. Sec-ond, for accurate modeling of latency in different configurations at each layer,we propose the concept ofbilayer configuration latency, which considers simul-taneous variations in both input and output channel counts across all layers.To incorporate these two strategies, we reformulate pruning as a Mixed-IntegerNonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]. This allows us to directly solve for theoptimal pruned structure adhering to a specific latency budget with only a singlepass. As a result, our framework enhances pruning performance with significantlatency reductions. All together, we refer to our method asMulti-DimensionalPruning (MDP).Our code will be provided upon acceptance.Our extensive experiments, with a glimpse showcased in Figure 1, validateour method\u2019s superior performance, particularlyat high pruning ratios. In clas-sification with an aggressive85% pruning ratio, we significantly outperform theprevious work, HALP [54], with a speed increase of +1161 im/s and an accuracyimprovement of +1.4. For 3D object detection, we prune the StreamPETR [60]model comprising of a CNN feature extractor and transformer based decoder.We establish a new state-of-the-art at a45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS(37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline. At a largerpruning ratio of70%, we significantly outpace HALP [54] in both FPS (43.3 vs.42.5) and mAP (0.394 vs. 0.373). We summarize our contributions as follows:\u2013 We introduce ablock groupingstrategy for simultaneous channel and blockpruning, allowing collective decision-making in optimization.\u2013 We propose a method to accurately formulate latency for different layerconfigurations, capturing variations in both input and output channels.--- Page 4 ---4 X.Sun et al.\u2013 We organically combine the above strategies with a novel pruning frameworkredefining pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) whichdirectly solves a globally optimal pruned structure within specific latencyconstraints efficiently with a single-pass.\u2013 We conduct extensive experiments and observe state-of-the-art accuracy-latency trade-offs in a wide range of settings, covering (a) ImageNet [16] forclassification, Pascal VOC [20] for 2D detection, and Nuscenes [9] for 3Ddetection (b) with three model architectures: ResNet-50 [25], SSD [43], andStreamPETR [60] (c) across various latency reduction pruning ratios.2 Related WorksOurworkcanbecategorizedasapruningmethodingeneral.Wewillnowprovidea brief overview of the field and highlight our differences from the previousapproaches. Pruning methods [1,23,24,36,39,40,48,50,54,56] mostly designimportance criterion to rank parameters and remove the lowest-ranked ones,followed by an additional finetuning for accuracy recovery.Channel Pruning Some pruning methods [14,26\u201328,31,39,40,50,54,57,67]operate under structural constraints, for example removing convolutional chan-nels [39] from CNNs, thus enjoy immediate performance improvement withoutspecialized hardware or library support. Exemplary channel importance criterionrelied on metrics like weight norm [14,26,27,39,67], Taylor expansion [41,50,68],geometric median [28], and feature maps rank [40]. Our method leverages theTaylor [50] channel importance criterion but extend it to evaluate the configu-rations of entire layers and blocks, going beyond just pruning channel but alsocombining layer and block removals.Layer and Block PruningChannel pruning methods have been effective inreducing performance loss while removing a moderate number of parameters.However, their effectiveness is limited when it comes to more extensive pruning.This is because they focus only on removing channels, but to achieve optimalresults with significant pruning, it becomes necessary to remove entire layers orblocks. Only a limited number of works [11,19,58,61,62,64] focus on pruninglayers and blocks. [12] and [19] employ intermediate features at each layer tocompute a layer ranking score with linear classifier probes [12] or imprinting [19]and remove the lowest ranked layers. [61] introduces linear classifier probe aftereach block to check performance and remove blocks with the smallest improve-ments from the previous. Recent method [62] also studies individually removingeach block and calculating importance based on the performance drop.Though shown to provide larger speedups than channel pruning, all of theseapproaches [11,19,58,61,62,64] only operate at the layer or block granularityand fail if we want to introduce channel sparsity simultaneously. Additionally,some add extra module or parameters like linear probes [12,61] that requireadditional training and complicate the process. Our methodseamlessly uniteschannel and block pruning, which allows us to efficiently determine an optimalpruned structure at both the channel and block levels with just a single pass onthe pre-trained model, without any need for extra training or parameters.--- Page 5 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 5Hardware-aware Pruning Since parameter compression ratio does not di-rectly translate into computation reduction ratio, some works [38,63,67] focusprimarily on reducing model FLOPs. Latest methods go one step further andperform hardware-aware pruning which aims to directly reduce the hardwareinference latency. The representative work HALP [54] first prepares a latencylookup table for all configurations of prunable parameters measured on the tar-get hardware then formulate pruning as a knapsack problem [55], maximizingtotal parameter importance while constraining the total associated latency un-der a given budget. [52] later demonstrates that HALP can be applied to au-tonomous systems to achieve real-time detection performance. To enhance thelearning capacity of pruned models, SMCP [31] introduces soft masking withinthe HALP framework, enabling the reconsideration of earlier pruned weights inan iterative pruning setting.Although these methods [31,52,54] have made notable progress in accuracyand speed, their reliance on an inaccurate latency estimation leads to subopti-mal accuracy-latency trade-offs. They account for changes in output channelsbut overlook simultaneous variations in input channels caused by pruning thepreceding layer. This issue is more pronounced when aiming for large latencyreductions, as it becomes more challenging to guide pruning to meet the desiredlatency budget without accurate latency modeling. In our work, we also focuson hardware-aware pruningbut introduce a more accurate latency modeling tech-nique that accounts for simultaneous variations in both input and output channelcounts across all layers, allowing us to determine optimal configurations globally.Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]As our strategiesof block pruning and accurate latency modeling are unified with a MINLP for-mulation, we will briefly introduce the field. Formally defined in [37], MINLPsare optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables, where theobjective and constraints are nonlinear functions. Effectively and efficiently solv-ing MINLP [3\u20135,17,18,21,22] is a critical area in optimization research, with keycomponent often involving decomposing the problem into Mixed-Integer LinearPrograms (MILP) and Nonlinear Programs (NLP). Recently, conveniently mod-eling and solving MINLPs in Python has been made possible with Pyomo [8]and MindtPy [2]. In this paper, we use the Outer Approximation (OA) [17,21]method with Pyomo [8] and MindtPy [2] to solve our pruning MINLP.3 MethodologyWe will now present our pruning framework. We begin by establishing prelimi-naries, defining our goals and declaring relevant notations. We then describe ourproposed pruning formulation in detail.PreliminariesFortheneuralnetworkwith L convolutionlayersintotal,werep-resent the convolution parameters as\u0398 = SLl=1 \u0398l, s.t.\u0398l \u2208 Rml\xd7ml\u22121\xd7Kl\xd7Kl ,where ml, ml\u22121, Kl denote the number of output channels, input channels, andkernel size at layerl respectively. Following [25,47], a block is defined as the setof layers(e.g. bottleneck [25]) skipped by a residual connection. Suppose there is--- Page 6 ---6 X.Sun et al.a total ofB blocks in the network\u0398. Given a desired inference latency,\u03a8, ourgoal is to find the most performant subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 \u2286 \u0398 through pruning, suchthat the inference latency of\u02c6\u0398 is below the budget\u03a8 on the target hardware.Additionally, we declare the following entities(all1-indexed):Name Notation Explanationlayer2block \u03b2(l) \u2208 [1, B] map layerl to ID of the block it belongs tolayer channel variableyl \u2208 {0,1}ml , one-hotyil = 1if layerl keepsi out ofml channelsblock decision variablezb \u2208 {0,1}, b\u2208 [1, B] zb = 0if the entirebth block is prunedTo elaborate, the layer channel variablesyl is defined as one-hot vector,where the index of the hot bit representsthe total numberof selected channelsin the pruned network\u02c6\u0398, ranging from1 to ml. If thebth block is pruned (i.e.zb = 0), all layers in this block(\u03b2(l) =b) are removed, regardless of the value ofyl. In this case, the channel count becomes0.The layer channel variablesy and block decision variablesz describe thepruning decisions and encode the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398, and they are our targetsto jointly optimize. In the following sections, we will describe how to solve thembased on information we collected from the pre-trained network\u0398.3.1 Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP)To understand how performant a pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 is, following previousworks [31,39,40,50,54], we leverage importance score as a proxy. The optimalsubnetwork \u02c6\u0398 is considered to be the one that maximizes the importance scorewhile closely adhering to the latency constraint\u03a8. With large latency reductionfrom the original model\u0398, we need to consider potential removal of layers andblocks while guiding the pruning decisions with accurate latency estimations.To identify this optimal subnetwork encoded by layer channel variables (y) andblock decision variables (z), we begin by defining two key components, the im-portance score for different values ofy and z and accurate latency estimationfor these varying configurations, for each individual layer. The final objective isthe aggregation of these components across all layers of the model.Next, to seamlessly combine complete layer and block removal with channelsparsity, we perform ablock groupingstep which groups the latency and impor-tance expression for all layers within the same block under a single block decisionvariable. We then formulate the above as aMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program-ming (MINLP)to jointly determiney and z for an optimal pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 at both the channel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnet-work structure \u02c6\u0398 from the solver\u2019s output ofy and z and carry out a finetuningsession on \u02c6\u0398 for E epochs to recover the accuracy. All together, we refer to ourmethod as Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP). A paradigm diagram of MDPis demonstrated in Fig. 2. We are now going to describe the details of each step.Layer Importance ComputationAs discussed in Sec.2, the quality of thepruned subnetworks could be conveniently assessed with channel importance--- Page 7 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 7scores. With Taylor importance score [50], the importance of thejth channel atlayer l can be computed as:Ijl = |g\u03b3jl\u03b3jl + g\u03b2jl\u03b2jl |, (1)where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are BatchNorm layer\u2019s weight and bias for the correspondingchannel, andg\u03b3 and g\u03b2 are the gradients.As the number of channels kept in a layerl is directly encoded by the one-hot variablesyl, we associate an importance score for each possible configurationyl could take, with the one-hot bit index ranging from1 to ml. We leverage agreedy approach to derive this. For example, if at layerl pruning keepsi channels(i.e. yil = 1), we would like thesei channels to be the top-i most important.Therefore, we first rank individual channel importance scoresIl at layer l inascending order. Then to compute layer importance score\u02c6Iil corresponding toyl with yil = 1, we aggregate thei highest channel importance scores.Formally, this is expressed as:\u02c6Iil =XTop-i(Il), \u2200i \u2208 [1, ml] (2)The vector\u02c6Il \u2208 Rml fully describes the importance scores for all possible numberof channels layerl could take from1 to ml. We thereby define theimportance atlayer l for a specific configurationyl as a simple dot-product:yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il.Latency ModelingIn order to accurately guide our pruning, we fully describethe latency variations with respect to both the number of its output and inputchannels and construct a latency cost matrixCl for each convolution layerl asfollows:Cl =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0Tl(1, 1) Tl(1, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(1, ml)Tl(2, 1) Tl(2, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(2, ml)...... ... ...Tl(ml\u22121, 1) Tl(ml\u22121, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(ml\u22121, ml)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (3)Here, Tl is a pre-built latency lookup table, which could be measured on thetarget hardware beforehand as prior works [31,52,54], andTl(i, j) returns thelatency of layerl with i input channels andj output channels, upper-bounded bythe total channel countml\u22121 and ml in \u0398. Cl enumerates latency correspondingtoallpossibilitieslayer l couldbe,varyingtheinputandoutputchannelnumbers.With these configurations encoded in the one-hot layer channel variablesyl\u22121and yl, we define thebilayer configuration latencyat layerl for specificyl\u22121 andyl simply as two dot-products:yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl).We can observe that eachyl appears twice in the expressions, once at com-puting latency for layerl, and once at layerl+1. While this poses some challengesin optimization, it manages to accurately capture the full overall latency land-scape of network. This approach enables us to guide the pruning process withmore precise latency estimations, significantly improving the precision from pre-vious methods [31,52,54] that did not consider the simultaneous contributionsfrom both output and input channel dimension.--- Page 8 ---8 X.Sun et al.Block GroupingNotice that we define the layer channel variablesyl to onlydescribechannelcountfrom 1 toml,excludingthecasewhenpruningremovesallchannels from layerl(i.e. channel count of0). This means if we only use variablesy to represent the pruned model\u02c6\u0398, we cannot represent completely removinga layer from the network; at best, we can reduce it to just one channel, similarto previous methods [31,52,54]. This is intentional because arbitrarily pruninga single layer could easily lead to network disconnection, causing discontinuityin the information flow of the network. However, residual blocks are inherentlyresilient to removal of all their internal layers at once, as the skip connectionallows information to bypass the removed layers, preserving gradient flow.To handle the removal of an entire residual block structure, we introduceblock grouping where layers are grouped into the block it belongs to. Specifically,we parse the network architecture to obtain thelayer2block mapping \u03b2(l) forevery layerl. Then we group all importance and latency expressions within thesame block under a single block decision variable. If pruning decides to removethe bth block, the importance and latency contributions from all layers withinthat block, where\u03b2(l) =b, should be simultaneously set to0.We model this group decision with the binary block decision variableszb.Subsequently, for each layerl, we first determine whether its associated blockdecision variable, denoted byz\u03b2(l), is active (z\u03b2(l) = 1). Only if it is active, weevaluate the layer importance and latency expressions determined byy; other-wise, they are simply zeroed. Theimportancefor layerl is determined by bothyland z\u03b2(l), and can be expressed asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il). Similarly, thebilayer configu-ration latencyat convolution layerl can be represented asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\xb7(yl\u22121\u22a4\xb7Cl)).Block removal is properly handled by giving the block decision variableszshigher \u2019priority\u2019 than the layer channel variablesys. For example, deactivatingz1 results in the exclusion of all layers within the first block(where\u03b2(l) = 1) bysimultaneously setting their importance and latency expressions to0, regardlessof the values taken by theiryls. Also, notice that for thelayers that do not belongto any block structures, their correspondingzs are simply always1.Solve MINLPWe aim to jointly determine the optimal layer channel and blockdecisions(y andz)thatmaximizethesummationoftheir importance scoreswhileensuring the cumulativebilayer configuration latencyremains below the budget\u03a8. Formally, this can be represented with the following Mixed-Integer NonlinearProgramming (MINLP) formulation:arg maxy,zLXl=1z\u03b2(l) \xb7 (yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il) (4)s.t.LXl=1z\u03b2(l)\xb7(yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl)) \u2264 \u03a8We restrict all decision variablesy and z to binary values, while the layerimportances \u02c6Il and latency cost matricesCl contain floating-point numbers,hence making the program mixed-integer in nature.

Since we jointly optimize all variables, we candirectly determine a globally optimal set ofy and z with only a single pass.Extract Pruned StructureOnce we solved the MINLP program 4, we proceedto extract the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 based on the variablesy and z determinedby the solver. If block decision variablezb is set to0 for a particular blockb,we completely remove that block in\u02c6\u0398 and disregard the solver\u2019s output for thelayer channel variables(yl) of the layers within that block (where\u03b2(l) =b). Onthe other hand, if the block is active withzb = 1and the solver returns the valueof y with yil = 1, we keepi channels in \u02c6\u0398 at layerl according to ArgTopK(Il, i),mapping layer importance\u02c6Il in Eqn.2 back to thei top-performing channels.In practice, since the layer importances\u02c6I are built from Taylor score [50] mea-sured using gradient information from data batches, we perform pruning afterone epoch when the model has seen all of the samples in the dataset and accumu-late their importance estimation. After pruning, we finetune the pruned model\u02c6\u0398 for a duration ofE epochs to recover accuracy. An algorithmic description ofthe above process is provided in Algorithm 1.--- Page 10 ---10 X.Sun et al.4 ExperimentsTo validate the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments across acomprehensive set of scenarios. We demonstrate our pruning results on 3 tasks:image classification with ImageNet [16] and ResNet50 [25], 2D object detectionwith Pascal VOC [20] and SSD [43], and 3D object detection with Nuscenes [9]and StreamPETR [60].Our method improves upon previous approaches by providing(a)more accu-rate latency estimation and(b) the ability to handle the removal of entire layerand block structures. These improvements are reflected in our superior result,as we achieve a new state-of-the-art with a significantly better accuracy-latencytrade-off compared to prior arts [31,54] and other competitive baselines [38,59],especially at higher pruning ratios. To provide a comprehensive understanding ofour proposed pruning framework, we also conducted an in-depth ablation study,highlighting the individual contribution of our improvement from(a) and (b).Settings For ResNet50 and SSD, we aimed to optimize their inference latencyon the Nvidia TITAN V GPU with batch size of256. When pruning Stream-PETR [60], we adapted our approach to target the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090GPU batch size of1, aligning with the focus of StreamPETR\u2019s original paper.This allowed us to fairly evaluate the speedup benefits and also demonstrate thegeneralization of our method targeting different hardware platforms.All of our trainings use 8 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs and conducted withPyTorch [51] V1.4.0. Our CPU is Intel Xeon E5-2698 and is used to solve theMINLP optimization(Eqn. 4).4.1 Classification Results on ImageNetIn Table 1, We report our pruning results and comparison with the baselinemethods on ResNet50 [25] and ImageNet [16]. We evaluate these results usingTop-1 Accuracy and Top-5 Accuracy to gauge the recovered accuracy after fine-tuning. In addition, we include inference FPS (im/s, i.e. images per second) todirectly showcase the speedups on the target hardware. We also present FLOPsfor completeness.Compared with previous methods like HALP [54] and SMCP [31], we achievea significantly improved accuracy-latency trade-off. For instance, SMCP reachesa Top-1 accuracy of 72.7 with an inference speed of 3784 im/s; our methodslightly surpasses its Top-1 with an accuracy of72.8 but with a considerablyfaster inference speed of 4210 im/s. With larger pruning, HALP achieves aTop-1 accuracy of68.6 with an inference speed of4101 im/s, our method signif-icantly outperforms it with a Top-1 accuracy of70.0 and an impressive FPS of5262 im/s. Notably, we can observe from Table 1 that our method particularlyexcels when targeting high FPS with substantial pruning from pre-trainedmodels, corroborating the effectiveness of improvements from our method. Ourimprovements could be observed more clearly in the FPS v.s.

In Figure 3b, we present the outcomes of our pruning method-ology applied to an SSD512 [43] model with a ResNet50 backbone. Our perfor-mance is assessed against various competitive baselines, including HALP [54]and SMCP [31]. We depict the Pareto frontier, showcasing the trade-off betweenFPS and mean Average Precision (mAP).Our results distinctly outshine existing methods in the field, marking a sub-stantial advancement.

Modern systems--- Page 13 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 13deploy convolutional layers for features extraction and transformer layers forcapturing global cues [15,65]. In this section, we explore our pruning effectivenessfor these hybrid models. We focus on the challenging task of 3D object detection,using the widely recognized Nuscenes [9] dataset and the state-of-the-art modelStreamPETR [60], composed of a heavy CNN-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. Our analysis of the system\u2019s latency revealed that the CNN-basedencoder has a higher latency (16.7ms) than the transformer decoder (14ms).This indicates that applying our method to the convolutional layers can stilleffectively accelerate the entire network.Detailed results and comparisons with several competitive baselines are pre-sentedinTable 2.Ourevaluationincorporatedadiversesetofmetricscommonlyadopted for 3D object detection tasks [9,42,60], including the mean Average Pre-cision (mAP) and Normalized Detection Score (NDS). Additionally, we reportthe FPS to highlight the improvements in speed.Significantly, when compared to the dense pre-trained StreamPETR model,our technique achieved a substantial acceleration of approximately18%, result-ing in an impressive37.3 FPS as opposed to the baseline\u2019s31.7 FPS. Impor-tantly,thisspeedboostwasachievedwithoutsacrificingperformance:ourprunedmodel attained superior mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) and NDS (0.551 vs. 0.546). Incomparison to the previous pruning method HALP [54], our approach exhibitedremarkable improvements in accuracy-latency trade-offs across various pruningratios. For instance, HALP managed to produce a pruned StreamPETR modelwith an mAP of0.373, an NDS of0.489, and an inference FPS of42.5. In con-trast, our approach surpassed these results, achieving an mAP of0.394, an NDSof 0.512, and an inference FPS of43.3.4.4 Ablation Study4.4.1 As discussed in detail in Sec. 3.1, our pruning method introduces twokey improvements from prior methods: (a)\u201cbilayer configuration latency" foraccurate latency modeling;(b)"block grouping" for integration of block removalwith channel sparsity.We\u2019ll now explore the individual impacts of(a) and (b) on pruning perfor-mance. Thebaseline here is thus a bare latency pruning algorithm without both(a) and (b). We then ablate each component by separately adding them on topof the baseline to check inidividual improvement. The baseline performance isdepicted in Fig. 4 with label \u201cBaseline".Bilayer Configuration LatencyIn this setting, we add our \u201cbilayer configura-tion latency" on top of the baseline but drop theblock groupingstep to excludethe block decision variables from the MINLP program 4. This variant accuratelyestimates the latency impacts of pruning by considering variations in both inputand output channel counts, but it cannot handle removal of entire blocks. Theresult, labeled \u201cOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)" in Fig. 4, show a markedly betteraccuracy-latency tradeoff than the baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness evenwhen used alone.--- Page 14 ---14 X.Sun et al.2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1BaselineOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)Ours(Only Block Grouping)OursFig. 4: Ablation study results on Ima-geNet with ResNet50.

Instead, we use previous methods\u2019 latency modeling [31,52,54],which only account for variations in output channel counts. This variant caneffectively handle the removal of block strucutres to accommodate high pruningratiosbutbutcannotaccuratelyestimatelatencyimpactsbyconsideringchangesin both input and output channel counts. The results, labeled \u201cOurs(Only BlockGrouping)" in Fig. 4, show an evidently improved accuracy-latency tradeoff com-pared to the baseline, particularly at large pruning ratios and latency reduc-tion(rightmost points in the curves). This indicates the effectiveness of "blockgrouping" even when used independently.4.4.2 By integrating our above two strategies into a unified MINLP frame-work, we enable efficient and single-pass pruning.Single-passv.s.IterativePruning Oursingle-passpruningapproachachievesthe target latency in just one step, while iterative methods like HALP [54] re-quire up to 30 steps. Performance comparisons between our method and HALPacross different pruning steps are shown in Table 3.As observed, our approach performs consistently well regardless of the prun-ing steps. Our single-pass performance is even better than our 30-steps iterativepruning. We believe this is likely due to the benefit of using importance scoresfrom all samples in the dataset at once.In contrast, HALP\u2019s performance worsens with fewer pruning steps, espe-cially in single-pass pruning where it defies the latency budget and over-prunes,leading to a Top-1 of65.1 and FPS of4444. This behavior is because the over-sights of (a) and (b) can be somewhat mitigated with multiple pruning steps,but become more pronounced with just one or fewer steps.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce a novel pruning framework called MDP that inte-grates channel, layer, and block pruning within a unified optimization processand develop an accurate latency modeling technique that captures simultane-ous input and output channel variations. To incorporate these strategies, we--- Page 15 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 15reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to effi-ciently identify the optimal pruned structure within a specific latency budgetin a single pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over pre-vious methods, especially in scenarios requiring large pruning. We also pro-vide an in-depth ablation study to investigate each contribution individually.References1.

Sun, X., Hassani, A., Wa, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model distillation optimization\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #21, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model distillation optimization\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem. In this paper, we consider a three-way trade-off between\nbit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud\nimage classification system. Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Improved Multiple-Image-Based Reflection Removal Algorithm Using Deep Neural Networks\nSummary: When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection\nof another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the\nquality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a\nnovel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in\nimaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require\nlong computation time for solving different optimization functions, their\nperformance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in\nnowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based\ndepth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The\nproposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in\nthe image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are\nthen used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.\nSince edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,\nthey are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,\nthe estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to\nassist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed\ncompared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-08-09\narXiv paper ID: 2208.04679v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #6, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nneural architecture search edge devices image classification\n```\nStep #7, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query neural architecture search edge devices image classification, here was the response\nTitle: Search-time Efficient Device Constraints-Aware Neural Architecture Search\nSummary: Edge computing aims to enable edge devices, such as IoT devices, to process\ndata locally instead of relying on the cloud. However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms.

In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #20, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layerand Block Pruning with Latency ConstraintXinglong Sun1,2\u22c6, Barath Lakshmanan1, Maying Shen1, Shiyi Lan1, JingdeChen1, and Jose Alvarez11 NVIDIA2 Stanford University{xinglongs, blakshmanan, mshen, shiyil, joshchen, josea}@nvidia.com2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1EagleEye (ECCV'20)MetaPruning (ICCV'19)AutoSlim (NeurIPS'19)0.50 x ResNet50ResNet18HALP (NeurIPS'22)SMCP (ECCV'22)Ours+4.2Top1+ 426FPS+ 1161 FPS +2.1mAP+5.6 FPSFig. 1:MDP exhibits Pareto dominance across different tasks.

In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-artby pruning StreamPETR [60] at a45% pruning ratio, achieving higherFPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.Keywords: Network Pruning, Model Acceleration, MINLP.1 IntroductionDeep neural networks have become the de-facto standards of advanced com-puter vision applications, ranging from image classification [25] to object de-tection [43] and segmentation [46]. Contemporary networks [15,60,65] usuallyconsist of both convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractorsand transformer blocks to capture global cues. As the performance advances,the models swell in size correspondingly, containing millions or even billions ofparameters [33]. This growth in model size presents challenges for deploymenton resource-constrained edge devices, hinders real-time inference tasks such asautonomous driving, and incurs significant costs for training and inference oncloud systems. Pruning [23,50,54], which involves removing redundant parame-ters from the network, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the modelcomputation and size to reach real-time requirements without significantly com-promising its accuracy. To keep pace with the ever-expanding model sizes, weneed very aggressive pruningtechniques to significantly reduce latency for effi-cient and real-time model deployment.Channel pruning [31,38,39,50,52\u201354,59], in particular, has garnered signif-icant attention as an effective pruning technique to reduce model computation,usually 30% - 50%, practically without requiring changes in the hardware. Chan-nel pruning involves removing redundant convolution filters identified by someimportance criterion [39,40,50], usually starting from a pre-trained model. De-spite advancements, these methods have two critical limitations. First, channelpruning methods are confined to pruning on the channel level, while we cannot avoid the structural removal of entire blocks or layers to achieve the largerpruning ratios required (70%-90%). Only a few works [11,19,58,61,62,64] ad-dress layer or block pruning. These methods can provide greater accelerationthan channel pruning, but they are restricted to pruning at the layer or blockgranularity and cannot simultaneously introduce channel sparsity, resulting insuboptimal accuracy.Second, current pruning approaches to directly reduce inference latency uselatency models that only account for variations in output channel count at eachlayer, ignoring the simultaneous impact of pruning on input channels [10,13,31,34,49,52,54,66]. This inaccurate latency estimation leads to sub-optimaltrade-offs between accuracy and latency, especially at the larger pruning ratiosrequired for inference on the edge. With large pruning ratios, guiding pruningtoward an optimal structure becomes more challenging while adhering closely tothe desired latency without precise modeling.--- Page 3 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 3INPUTCONV + RELUPOOLING2x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 1BlockDecisionVariableLayerChannel Variable1 \U0001d49a\U0001d7cf1\U0001d467"\u2208{0,1} 2 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d03 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d12\U0001d467%\u2208{0,1}4 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d25 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d36 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d4\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u20260.040.070.120.170.080.110.180.20.110.150.210.230.160.190.240.280.180.240.290.32latency cost matrixMINLP Solver layerschannelsExtract Pruned Subnetwork3x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 2\u2026Pretrained Model\u201ccat\u201d\u0398\U0001d458\U0001d458\U0001d48e\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7d2\U0001d48e\U0001d7d0=\U0001d7d3Zoomed-in Layer 3\u0398!\u2208\U0001d445"\xd7$\xd7%\xd7%0.91.30.20.5ChannelImportance0.91.30.20.5Sorting1.32.22.72.9LayerImportanceCompute Layer ImportanceScore every possible channel count$\U0001d43c!Output Channel Count Input Channel Count \U0001d436!Compute LatencyCapture both in. and out. dims. changesBlock Grouping\U0001d466+,=1\U0001d466--=1\U0001d466.,\U0001d466/,\U0001d4660:\U0001d45b/\U0001d44e\U0001d466,+=1argmax\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5(\U0001d466!'\u22c5$\U0001d43c!)+\u2026s.t.\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5\U0001d466!\u22c5\U0001d466('\u22c5\U0001d436!+\u22ef\u2264\u03a8MINLP Formulation w/Latency and Importance Expression of Layer 3\U0001d467,=1 \U0001d467+=0 blocksFinetuningTopK&SumOne-hot Vector0 10 0Eg.\U0001d49a\U0001d7d1\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7cf: Keep 3Output Channels at Layer 3Fig. 2:Paradigm of our proposed method MDP. We start by computing layer im-portance and constructing latency cost matrices for each layer. We then group layerswithin the same block and solve an MINLP to optimize pruning decisions at bothchannel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnetwork and finetune it.This paper presents a novel pruning framework that effectively overcomes thelimitations of existing methods. Specifically, we do not model channels or layersseparately. Instead, we first group channels and layers within the same block inour formulation, allowing them to be handled jointly in the optimization process.This unified approach seamlessly integrates channel, layer, and block pruning,enabling us to identify the optimal pruned structure at all levels efficiently. Sec-ond, for accurate modeling of latency in different configurations at each layer,we propose the concept ofbilayer configuration latency, which considers simul-taneous variations in both input and output channel counts across all layers.To incorporate these two strategies, we reformulate pruning as a Mixed-IntegerNonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]. This allows us to directly solve for theoptimal pruned structure adhering to a specific latency budget with only a singlepass. As a result, our framework enhances pruning performance with significantlatency reductions.

Exemplary channel importance criterionrelied on metrics like weight norm [14,26,27,39,67], Taylor expansion [41,50,68],geometric median [28], and feature maps rank [40]. Our method leverages theTaylor [50] channel importance criterion but extend it to evaluate the configu-rations of entire layers and blocks, going beyond just pruning channel but alsocombining layer and block removals.Layer and Block PruningChannel pruning methods have been effective inreducing performance loss while removing a moderate number of parameters.However, their effectiveness is limited when it comes to more extensive pruning.This is because they focus only on removing channels, but to achieve optimalresults with significant pruning, it becomes necessary to remove entire layers orblocks. Only a limited number of works [11,19,58,61,62,64] focus on pruninglayers and blocks. [12] and [19] employ intermediate features at each layer tocompute a layer ranking score with linear classifier probes [12] or imprinting [19]and remove the lowest ranked layers. [61] introduces linear classifier probe aftereach block to check performance and remove blocks with the smallest improve-ments from the previous. Recent method [62] also studies individually removingeach block and calculating importance based on the performance drop.Though shown to provide larger speedups than channel pruning, all of theseapproaches [11,19,58,61,62,64] only operate at the layer or block granularityand fail if we want to introduce channel sparsity simultaneously. Additionally,some add extra module or parameters like linear probes [12,61] that requireadditional training and complicate the process. Our methodseamlessly uniteschannel and block pruning, which allows us to efficiently determine an optimalpruned structure at both the channel and block levels with just a single pass onthe pre-trained model, without any need for extra training or parameters.--- Page 5 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 5Hardware-aware Pruning Since parameter compression ratio does not di-rectly translate into computation reduction ratio, some works [38,63,67] focusprimarily on reducing model FLOPs. Latest methods go one step further andperform hardware-aware pruning which aims to directly reduce the hardwareinference latency. The representative work HALP [54] first prepares a latencylookup table for all configurations of prunable parameters measured on the tar-get hardware then formulate pruning as a knapsack problem [55], maximizingtotal parameter importance while constraining the total associated latency un-der a given budget. [52] later demonstrates that HALP can be applied to au-tonomous systems to achieve real-time detection performance. To enhance thelearning capacity of pruned models, SMCP [31] introduces soft masking withinthe HALP framework, enabling the reconsideration of earlier pruned weights inan iterative pruning setting.Although these methods [31,52,54] have made notable progress in accuracyand speed, their reliance on an inaccurate latency estimation leads to subopti-mal accuracy-latency trade-offs. They account for changes in output channelsbut overlook simultaneous variations in input channels caused by pruning thepreceding layer. This issue is more pronounced when aiming for large latencyreductions, as it becomes more challenging to guide pruning to meet the desiredlatency budget without accurate latency modeling. In our work, we also focuson hardware-aware pruningbut introduce a more accurate latency modeling tech-nique that accounts for simultaneous variations in both input and output channelcounts across all layers, allowing us to determine optimal configurations globally.Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]As our strategiesof block pruning and accurate latency modeling are unified with a MINLP for-mulation, we will briefly introduce the field. Formally defined in [37], MINLPsare optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables, where theobjective and constraints are nonlinear functions. Effectively and efficiently solv-ing MINLP [3\u20135,17,18,21,22] is a critical area in optimization research, with keycomponent often involving decomposing the problem into Mixed-Integer LinearPrograms (MILP) and Nonlinear Programs (NLP). Recently, conveniently mod-eling and solving MINLPs in Python has been made possible with Pyomo [8]and MindtPy [2]. In this paper, we use the Outer Approximation (OA) [17,21]method with Pyomo [8] and MindtPy [2] to solve our pruning MINLP.3 MethodologyWe will now present our pruning framework. We begin by establishing prelimi-naries, defining our goals and declaring relevant notations. We then describe ourproposed pruning formulation in detail.PreliminariesFortheneuralnetworkwith L convolutionlayersintotal,werep-resent the convolution parameters as\u0398 = SLl=1 \u0398l, s.t.\u0398l \u2208 Rml\xd7ml\u22121\xd7Kl\xd7Kl ,where ml, ml\u22121, Kl denote the number of output channels, input channels, andkernel size at layerl respectively. Following [25,47], a block is defined as the setof layers(e.g. bottleneck [25]) skipped by a residual connection. Suppose there is--- Page 6 ---6 X.Sun et al.a total ofB blocks in the network\u0398. Given a desired inference latency,\u03a8, ourgoal is to find the most performant subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 \u2286 \u0398 through pruning, suchthat the inference latency of\u02c6\u0398 is below the budget\u03a8 on the target hardware.Additionally, we declare the following entities(all1-indexed):Name Notation Explanationlayer2block \u03b2(l) \u2208 [1, B] map layerl to ID of the block it belongs tolayer channel variableyl \u2208 {0,1}ml , one-hotyil = 1if layerl keepsi out ofml channelsblock decision variablezb \u2208 {0,1}, b\u2208 [1, B] zb = 0if the entirebth block is prunedTo elaborate, the layer channel variablesyl is defined as one-hot vector,where the index of the hot bit representsthe total numberof selected channelsin the pruned network\u02c6\u0398, ranging from1 to ml. If thebth block is pruned (i.e.zb = 0), all layers in this block(\u03b2(l) =b) are removed, regardless of the value ofyl. In this case, the channel count becomes0.The layer channel variablesy and block decision variablesz describe thepruning decisions and encode the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398, and they are our targetsto jointly optimize. In the following sections, we will describe how to solve thembased on information we collected from the pre-trained network\u0398.3.1 Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP)To understand how performant a pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 is, following previousworks [31,39,40,50,54], we leverage importance score as a proxy. The optimalsubnetwork \u02c6\u0398 is considered to be the one that maximizes the importance scorewhile closely adhering to the latency constraint\u03a8. With large latency reductionfrom the original model\u0398, we need to consider potential removal of layers andblocks while guiding the pruning decisions with accurate latency estimations.To identify this optimal subnetwork encoded by layer channel variables (y) andblock decision variables (z), we begin by defining two key components, the im-portance score for different values ofy and z and accurate latency estimationfor these varying configurations, for each individual layer. The final objective isthe aggregation of these components across all layers of the model.Next, to seamlessly combine complete layer and block removal with channelsparsity, we perform ablock groupingstep which groups the latency and impor-tance expression for all layers within the same block under a single block decisionvariable. We then formulate the above as aMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program-ming (MINLP)to jointly determiney and z for an optimal pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 at both the channel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnet-work structure \u02c6\u0398 from the solver\u2019s output ofy and z and carry out a finetuningsession on \u02c6\u0398 for E epochs to recover the accuracy. All together, we refer to ourmethod as Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP). A paradigm diagram of MDPis demonstrated in Fig. 2. We are now going to describe the details of each step.Layer Importance ComputationAs discussed in Sec.2, the quality of thepruned subnetworks could be conveniently assessed with channel importance--- Page 7 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 7scores. With Taylor importance score [50], the importance of thejth channel atlayer l can be computed as:Ijl = |g\u03b3jl\u03b3jl + g\u03b2jl\u03b2jl |, (1)where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are BatchNorm layer\u2019s weight and bias for the correspondingchannel, andg\u03b3 and g\u03b2 are the gradients.As the number of channels kept in a layerl is directly encoded by the one-hot variablesyl, we associate an importance score for each possible configurationyl could take, with the one-hot bit index ranging from1 to ml. We leverage agreedy approach to derive this. For example, if at layerl pruning keepsi channels(i.e. yil = 1), we would like thesei channels to be the top-i most important.Therefore, we first rank individual channel importance scoresIl at layer l inascending order. Then to compute layer importance score\u02c6Iil corresponding toyl with yil = 1, we aggregate thei highest channel importance scores.Formally, this is expressed as:\u02c6Iil =XTop-i(Il), \u2200i \u2208 [1, ml] (2)The vector\u02c6Il \u2208 Rml fully describes the importance scores for all possible numberof channels layerl could take from1 to ml. We thereby define theimportance atlayer l for a specific configurationyl as a simple dot-product:yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il.Latency ModelingIn order to accurately guide our pruning, we fully describethe latency variations with respect to both the number of its output and inputchannels and construct a latency cost matrixCl for each convolution layerl asfollows:Cl =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0Tl(1, 1) Tl(1, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(1, ml)Tl(2, 1) Tl(2, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(2, ml)...... ... ...Tl(ml\u22121, 1) Tl(ml\u22121, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(ml\u22121, ml)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (3)Here, Tl is a pre-built latency lookup table, which could be measured on thetarget hardware beforehand as prior works [31,52,54], andTl(i, j) returns thelatency of layerl with i input channels andj output channels, upper-bounded bythe total channel countml\u22121 and ml in \u0398. Cl enumerates latency correspondingtoallpossibilitieslayer l couldbe,varyingtheinputandoutputchannelnumbers.With these configurations encoded in the one-hot layer channel variablesyl\u22121and yl, we define thebilayer configuration latencyat layerl for specificyl\u22121 andyl simply as two dot-products:yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl).We can observe that eachyl appears twice in the expressions, once at com-puting latency for layerl, and once at layerl+1. While this poses some challengesin optimization, it manages to accurately capture the full overall latency land-scape of network. This approach enables us to guide the pruning process withmore precise latency estimations, significantly improving the precision from pre-vious methods [31,52,54] that did not consider the simultaneous contributionsfrom both output and input channel dimension.--- Page 8 ---8 X.Sun et al.Block GroupingNotice that we define the layer channel variablesyl to onlydescribechannelcountfrom 1 toml,excludingthecasewhenpruningremovesallchannels from layerl(i.e. channel count of0). This means if we only use variablesy to represent the pruned model\u02c6\u0398, we cannot represent completely removinga layer from the network; at best, we can reduce it to just one channel, similarto previous methods [31,52,54]. This is intentional because arbitrarily pruninga single layer could easily lead to network disconnection, causing discontinuityin the information flow of the network. However, residual blocks are inherentlyresilient to removal of all their internal layers at once, as the skip connectionallows information to bypass the removed layers, preserving gradient flow.To handle the removal of an entire residual block structure, we introduceblock grouping where layers are grouped into the block it belongs to. Specifically,we parse the network architecture to obtain thelayer2block mapping \u03b2(l) forevery layerl. Then we group all importance and latency expressions within thesame block under a single block decision variable. If pruning decides to removethe bth block, the importance and latency contributions from all layers withinthat block, where\u03b2(l) =b, should be simultaneously set to0.We model this group decision with the binary block decision variableszb.Subsequently, for each layerl, we first determine whether its associated blockdecision variable, denoted byz\u03b2(l), is active (z\u03b2(l) = 1). Only if it is active, weevaluate the layer importance and latency expressions determined byy; other-wise, they are simply zeroed. Theimportancefor layerl is determined by bothyland z\u03b2(l), and can be expressed asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il). Similarly, thebilayer configu-ration latencyat convolution layerl can be represented asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\xb7(yl\u22121\u22a4\xb7Cl)).Block removal is properly handled by giving the block decision variableszshigher \u2019priority\u2019 than the layer channel variablesys. For example, deactivatingz1 results in the exclusion of all layers within the first block(where\u03b2(l) = 1) bysimultaneously setting their importance and latency expressions to0, regardlessof the values taken by theiryls. Also, notice that for thelayers that do not belongto any block structures, their correspondingzs are simply always1.Solve MINLPWe aim to jointly determine the optimal layer channel and blockdecisions(y andz)thatmaximizethesummationoftheir importance scoreswhileensuring the cumulativebilayer configuration latencyremains below the budget\u03a8. Formally, this can be represented with the following Mixed-Integer NonlinearProgramming (MINLP) formulation:arg maxy,zLXl=1z\u03b2(l) \xb7 (yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il) (4)s.t.LXl=1z\u03b2(l)\xb7(yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl)) \u2264 \u03a8We restrict all decision variablesy and z to binary values, while the layerimportances \u02c6Il and latency cost matricesCl contain floating-point numbers,hence making the program mixed-integer in nature.

Since we jointly optimize all variables, we candirectly determine a globally optimal set ofy and z with only a single pass.Extract Pruned StructureOnce we solved the MINLP program 4, we proceedto extract the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 based on the variablesy and z determinedby the solver. If block decision variablezb is set to0 for a particular blockb,we completely remove that block in\u02c6\u0398 and disregard the solver\u2019s output for thelayer channel variables(yl) of the layers within that block (where\u03b2(l) =b). Onthe other hand, if the block is active withzb = 1and the solver returns the valueof y with yil = 1, we keepi channels in \u02c6\u0398 at layerl according to ArgTopK(Il, i),mapping layer importance\u02c6Il in Eqn.2 back to thei top-performing channels.In practice, since the layer importances\u02c6I are built from Taylor score [50] mea-sured using gradient information from data batches, we perform pruning afterone epoch when the model has seen all of the samples in the dataset and accumu-late their importance estimation. After pruning, we finetune the pruned model\u02c6\u0398 for a duration ofE epochs to recover accuracy. An algorithmic description ofthe above process is provided in Algorithm 1.--- Page 10 ---10 X.Sun et al.4 ExperimentsTo validate the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments across acomprehensive set of scenarios. We demonstrate our pruning results on 3 tasks:image classification with ImageNet [16] and ResNet50 [25], 2D object detectionwith Pascal VOC [20] and SSD [43], and 3D object detection with Nuscenes [9]and StreamPETR [60].Our method improves upon previous approaches by providing(a)more accu-rate latency estimation and(b) the ability to handle the removal of entire layerand block structures. These improvements are reflected in our superior result,as we achieve a new state-of-the-art with a significantly better accuracy-latencytrade-off compared to prior arts [31,54] and other competitive baselines [38,59],especially at higher pruning ratios. To provide a comprehensive understanding ofour proposed pruning framework, we also conducted an in-depth ablation study,highlighting the individual contribution of our improvement from(a) and (b).Settings For ResNet50 and SSD, we aimed to optimize their inference latencyon the Nvidia TITAN V GPU with batch size of256. When pruning Stream-PETR [60], we adapted our approach to target the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090GPU batch size of1, aligning with the focus of StreamPETR\u2019s original paper.This allowed us to fairly evaluate the speedup benefits and also demonstrate thegeneralization of our method targeting different hardware platforms.All of our trainings use 8 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs and conducted withPyTorch [51] V1.4.0. Our CPU is Intel Xeon E5-2698 and is used to solve theMINLP optimization(Eqn. 4).4.1 Classification Results on ImageNetIn Table 1, We report our pruning results and comparison with the baselinemethods on ResNet50 [25] and ImageNet [16]. We evaluate these results usingTop-1 Accuracy and Top-5 Accuracy to gauge the recovered accuracy after fine-tuning. In addition, we include inference FPS (im/s, i.e. images per second) todirectly showcase the speedups on the target hardware. We also present FLOPsfor completeness.Compared with previous methods like HALP [54] and SMCP [31], we achievea significantly improved accuracy-latency trade-off. For instance, SMCP reachesa Top-1 accuracy of 72.7 with an inference speed of 3784 im/s; our methodslightly surpasses its Top-1 with an accuracy of72.8 but with a considerablyfaster inference speed of 4210 im/s. With larger pruning, HALP achieves aTop-1 accuracy of68.6 with an inference speed of4101 im/s, our method signif-icantly outperforms it with a Top-1 accuracy of70.0 and an impressive FPS of5262 im/s. Notably, we can observe from Table 1 that our method particularlyexcels when targeting high FPS with substantial pruning from pre-trainedmodels, corroborating the effectiveness of improvements from our method. Ourimprovements could be observed more clearly in the FPS v.s.

Our perfor-mance is assessed against various competitive baselines, including HALP [54]and SMCP [31]. We depict the Pareto frontier, showcasing the trade-off betweenFPS and mean Average Precision (mAP).Our results distinctly outshine existing methods in the field, marking a sub-stantial advancement.

In this section, we explore our pruning effectivenessfor these hybrid models. We focus on the challenging task of 3D object detection,using the widely recognized Nuscenes [9] dataset and the state-of-the-art modelStreamPETR [60], composed of a heavy CNN-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. Our analysis of the system\u2019s latency revealed that the CNN-basedencoder has a higher latency (16.7ms) than the transformer decoder (14ms).This indicates that applying our method to the convolutional layers can stilleffectively accelerate the entire network.Detailed results and comparisons with several competitive baselines are pre-sentedinTable 2.Ourevaluationincorporatedadiversesetofmetricscommonlyadopted for 3D object detection tasks [9,42,60], including the mean Average Pre-cision (mAP) and Normalized Detection Score (NDS). Additionally, we reportthe FPS to highlight the improvements in speed.Significantly, when compared to the dense pre-trained StreamPETR model,our technique achieved a substantial acceleration of approximately18%, result-ing in an impressive37.3 FPS as opposed to the baseline\u2019s31.7 FPS. Impor-tantly,thisspeedboostwasachievedwithoutsacrificingperformance:ourprunedmodel attained superior mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) and NDS (0.551 vs. 0.546). Incomparison to the previous pruning method HALP [54], our approach exhibitedremarkable improvements in accuracy-latency trade-offs across various pruningratios. For instance, HALP managed to produce a pruned StreamPETR modelwith an mAP of0.373, an NDS of0.489, and an inference FPS of42.5. In con-trast, our approach surpassed these results, achieving an mAP of0.394, an NDSof 0.512, and an inference FPS of43.3.4.4 Ablation Study4.4.1 As discussed in detail in Sec. 3.1, our pruning method introduces twokey improvements from prior methods: (a)\u201cbilayer configuration latency" foraccurate latency modeling;(b)"block grouping" for integration of block removalwith channel sparsity.We\u2019ll now explore the individual impacts of(a) and (b) on pruning perfor-mance. Thebaseline here is thus a bare latency pruning algorithm without both(a) and (b). We then ablate each component by separately adding them on topof the baseline to check inidividual improvement. The baseline performance isdepicted in Fig. 4 with label \u201cBaseline".Bilayer Configuration LatencyIn this setting, we add our \u201cbilayer configura-tion latency" on top of the baseline but drop theblock groupingstep to excludethe block decision variables from the MINLP program 4. This variant accuratelyestimates the latency impacts of pruning by considering variations in both inputand output channel counts, but it cannot handle removal of entire blocks. Theresult, labeled \u201cOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)" in Fig. 4, show a markedly betteraccuracy-latency tradeoff than the baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness evenwhen used alone.--- Page 14 ---14 X.Sun et al.2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1BaselineOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)Ours(Only Block Grouping)OursFig. 4: Ablation study results on Ima-geNet with ResNet50.

We show re-sults of ours and HALP [54] with differentpruning steps.Block GroupingIn this setting, we add our \u201cblock grouping" step to the base-line but do not use our \u201cbilayer configuration latency" to model latency impactsfrom pruning. Instead, we use previous methods\u2019 latency modeling [31,52,54],which only account for variations in output channel counts. This variant caneffectively handle the removal of block strucutres to accommodate high pruningratiosbutbutcannotaccuratelyestimatelatencyimpactsbyconsideringchangesin both input and output channel counts. The results, labeled \u201cOurs(Only BlockGrouping)" in Fig. 4, show an evidently improved accuracy-latency tradeoff com-pared to the baseline, particularly at large pruning ratios and latency reduc-tion(rightmost points in the curves). This indicates the effectiveness of "blockgrouping" even when used independently.4.4.2 By integrating our above two strategies into a unified MINLP frame-work, we enable efficient and single-pass pruning.Single-passv.s.IterativePruning Oursingle-passpruningapproachachievesthe target latency in just one step, while iterative methods like HALP [54] re-quire up to 30 steps. Performance comparisons between our method and HALPacross different pruning steps are shown in Table 3.As observed, our approach performs consistently well regardless of the prun-ing steps. Our single-pass performance is even better than our 30-steps iterativepruning. We believe this is likely due to the benefit of using importance scoresfrom all samples in the dataset at once.In contrast, HALP\u2019s performance worsens with fewer pruning steps, espe-cially in single-pass pruning where it defies the latency budget and over-prunes,leading to a Top-1 of65.1 and FPS of4444. This behavior is because the over-sights of (a) and (b) can be somewhat mitigated with multiple pruning steps,but become more pronounced with just one or fewer steps.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce a novel pruning framework called MDP that inte-grates channel, layer, and block pruning within a unified optimization processand develop an accurate latency modeling technique that captures simultane-ous input and output channel variations. To incorporate these strategies, we--- Page 15 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 15reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to effi-ciently identify the optimal pruned structure within a specific latency budgetin a single pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over pre-vious methods, especially in scenarios requiring large pruning. We also pro-vide an in-depth ablation study to investigate each contribution individually.References1.

Sun, X., Hassani, A., Wa, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model distillation optimization\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

Moreover, these methods often necessitate extensiveend-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to preserve model performance,which is not only time-consuming but also requires fully annotated datasets, thuspotentially negating the benefits of efficient network compression. In this paper, weintroduce a novel distillation technique that efficiently compresses the model viaconvex optimization \u2013 eliminating intermediate non-convex activation functionsand using only intermediate activations from the original model. Our approachenables distillation in a label-free data setting and achieves performance comparableto the original model without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our method for image classification models onmultiple standard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, ourmethod can outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our methodpromises significant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint modelson edge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We showthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations froma large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable to theirnon-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the intersectionof convex optimization and deep learning.Keywords Knowledge Distillation, Non-Convex/Convex Optimization, Convex Neural Networks,Label-Free Training, Edge Machine Learning.1 IntroductionDeep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the cornerstone for a broad range of applications suchas image classification, segmentation, natural language understanding and speech recognition (Rawatand Wang, 2017; Torfi et al., 2021; Alam et al., 2020; Sultana et al., 2020). The performance of thesemodels typically scale with their size, width and architectural complexity, leading to the developmentof increasingly large models to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, this also necessitatessignificant computational, memory and energy resources to attain reasonable performance (Biancoet al., 2018; Rosenfeld, 2021); making their deployment impractical for resource-constrained edgedevices \u2013 such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and wearable technology \u2013 which are of daily use(Ignatov et al., 2019; Anwar and Raychowdhury, 2020; Seng et al., 2023; Chen and Liu, 2021). Edgedeep learning is crucial in these contexts to enable real-time processing, reduce latency, and ensurereliable operation without constant network connectivity (Kusupati et al., 2018; Tan and Le, 2019;V oghoei et al., 2018; Zaidi et al., 2022). Even in cases where such devices can make predictions byoffloading the the computations to large models on cloud servers, developing memory and computePreprint. Under review.arXiv:2410.06567v1  [cs.LG]  9 Oct 2024--- Page 2 ---efficient models is still advantageous as it reduces network bandwidth usage, lowers operational costs,and allows cloud services to serve more clients within the same resource constraints.Non-convex optimization, which forms the bedrock of training DNNs, poses significant theoreticaland practical challenges. Finding the global minimum can be NP-hard in the worst case and theoptimization landscape is riddled with local minima (Yao, 1992; Bartlett and Ben-David, 1999)and saddle points (Dauphin et al., 2014), making it difficult to guarantee convergence to a globaloptimum (Choromanska et al., 2015). Moreover, even training these models in a distributed manneron multiple GPUs can take days or weeks to complete. Convex optimization, on the other hand, iswell-studied with strong theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms (Boyd and Vandenberghe,2004). While there are recent works that show one can reformulate the optimization of certainclasses of non-convex NNs as convex problems (Pilanci and Ergen, 2020a; Ergen et al., 2022a),convex models are generally considered less expressive than their non-convex counterparts (Guss andSalakhutdinov, 2019; Scarselli and Chung Tsoi, 1998) and have been overshadowed by the successof deep learning in recent years.Although large non-convex DNNs possess immense expressive power, they often contain redundantweights that contribute little to the overall performance in downstream tasks (Frankle and Carbin,2019; Han et al., 2015). This phenomenon called Implicit Bias has been well established in boththeory and practice (Soudry et al., 2024; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Morwani et al., 2023; Shah et al.,2020). Additionally, while DNNs have the capacity to memorize the training dataset, they often endup learning basic solutions that generalize well to test datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). Both of theseobservations motivate using smaller, compressed models that eliminate unnecessary parameters whileachieving comparable performance. Common techniques for model compression include networkpruning (Han et al., 2015), low-rank approximation (Denil et al., 2013), and quantization (Gong et al.,2014). However, these methods often significantly degrade performance of the resulting model unlesssupplemented by another round of extensive fine-tuning on the labeled training data post-compression,which may not be feasible in many practical scenarios. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promisingalternative that enables a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model (Hinton et al.,2015) by training the student to mimic the outputs or intermediate representations of the teacher bymatching certain statistical metrics between the two models. While KD can significantly enhance theperformance of the student model, it often still requires fine-tuning the student model on labeled datain conjunction with the activation matching objective, limiting its applicability in situations wherelabeled data or compute is scarce or unavailable.In this paper, we bridge the gap between the non-convex and convex regimes by demonstrating thatconvex neural network architectures can achieve performance comparable to non-convex models fordownstream tasks when leveraging rich feature representations. To demonstrate this, we focus on themodel compression via KD framework and propose a novel approach that compresses non-convexDNNs via convex optimization. Our approach replaces the original complex non-convex layers inthe teacher module with simpler layers having convex gating functions in the student module. Bymatching the activation values between the teacher and student modules, we eliminate the needfor post-compression fine-tuning on labeled data, making our method suitable for deployment inenvironments where labeled data is scarce. Our method not only maintains the performance of theoriginal large model, but also capitalizes on the favorable optimization landscape of convex models.This enables users to employ a range of highly efficient and specialized convex solvers tailored totheir resource requirements, resulting in faster convergence and the potential for on-device learningusing online data\u2014a significant advantage for edge devices with limited computational resources.Summary of our Contributions:Efficient Convex-based Distillation and Deployment: We introduce a novel knowledge distillationapproach that leverages convex neural network architectures to compress DNNs. By replacing non-convex layers with convex gating functions in the student module, we exploit the well-understoodtheoretical foundations and efficient algorithms available in the convex optimization literature. Ourmethod achieves better performance than non-convex distillation approaches even when using thesame optimizer due to a more favorable optimization landscape. Moreover, the convexity of thestudent module allows us to employ faster and more specialized convex optimization algorithms,leading to accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead. This facilitates real-timeexecution and on-device learning on resource-constrained edge devices.2--- Page 3 ---Label-Free Compression Without Fine-Tuning: Our method focuses on activation matchingbetween a larger non-convex teacher module and a smaller convex student module on unlabeleddata. We show that for many real-world tasks, convex distillation in itself sufficient for the resultingmodel to perform well at inference time, eliminating the need for any fine-tuning on labeled data aftercompression. This makes our approach applicable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.Bridging the Non-Convex and Convex Regimes: To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork that marries the expressive representational power of non-convex DNNs with the theoreticaland computational advantages of convex architectures. Our empirical results on real-world datasetsdemonstrate that convex student models can achieve high compression rates without sacrificingaccuracy, often significantly outperforming non-convex compression methods in low-sample andhigh-compression regimes. This provides strong empirical evidence supporting the viability of convexneural networks when leveraging rich features from pre-trained non-convex teacher models, openingnew avenues for research at the intersection of deep learning and convex optimization.2 Other Related WorkKnowledge distillation (KD) has been a pivotal technique for compressing DNNs by transferringknowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this section, we discuss severalrelated methods, highlighting their advantages and the limitations that our approach addresses.In their seminal work, Romero et al. (2015) introduced FitNets, where a thin and wide studentmodel mimics the behavior of a larger teacher models by matching intermediate representations.By aligning the activations of a guided layer in the student with the outputs of the hint layer in theteacher, they prevent over-regularization and allow effective learning of the student on the trainingdataset. Since Fitnets were introduced, many methods have proposed modifications on top of them,such as designing new types of features (Kim et al., 2020; Srinivas and Fleuret, 2018), changingthe teacher/student architectures (Lee et al., 2022) and distilling across multiple layers (Chen et al.,2021). However, nearly all of them require access to labeled training data for fine-tuning, and theoptimization process remains non-convex, making convergence guarantees difficult.Tung and Mori (2019) proposed a method inspired by contrastive learning: preserve the relativerepresentational structure of the data in the student model by ensuring that input pairs that producesimilar (or dissimilar) activations in the teacher model produce similar (or dissimilar) activationsin the student network. This approach improves generalization but is computationally expensive,especially with large batch, due to the quadratic complexity of producing pairwise comparisons.Further, training objective is a weighted sum of cross entropy loss between the pairwise similarityactivations and a fine-tuning loss on the training data, necessitating access to labeled training data.Heo et al. (2018) introduced an activation transfer loss that minimizes the differences in booleanactivation patterns instead. This addresses the issue of the \u21132 loss emphasizing samples with largeactivation differences while underweighting those with small yet significant differences, which canmake it difficult to differentiate between weak and zero responses. However, their method involvesoptimizing a computationally intensive non-convex objective function.Recent advances have explored KD without access to the original training data. Yin et al. Raikwarand Mishra (2022) proposed generating synthetic data by sampling from a Gaussian distribution andadjusting the distributions within the teacher model\u2019s hidden layers. While this allows for label-freedistillation, the synthetic data may not capture the complexity of real data distributions. Additionally,their method relies on specific implementations of BatchNorm layers in the teacher model and focuseson label-free distillation without addressing the challenges of non-convex optimization. Since ourmethod is only concerned with intermediate activations and not the input-output nature of samples, itis also directly applicable on the synthetic data generated by their approach.3 Preliminaries3.1 Notation[m] denotes the set {1, 2, . . . , m}. For a matrix A, Ai denotes ith row of A. For a vector x, xidenotes ith element of x. We sometimes use xj to denote an indexed vector; in this case xj,i denotesthe ith element of xj. \u2225 \xb7 \u22252 denotes euclidean norm of a vector. For a sparse vector v \u2208 Rd, wedefine the support as supp(v) ={i \u2208 [d]|vi \u0338= 0}. We use I to denote the identity matrix and 1 (\xb7)3--- Page 4 ---to be the indicator function. For a matrix V \u2208 Rd\xd7r, vec(V) \u2208 Rdr vectorizes the matrix V bystacking columns sequentially. Unless stated otherwise, n is the number of samples in the trainingdataset and d is the dimenionality of the input samples.3.2 Convex Neural NetworksPilanci and Ergen (2020b) prove that training a two-layer fully-connected NNs with ReLU activationscan be reformulated as standard convex optimization problems. This result is important because itallows us to leverage convex optimization techniques while retaining the expressive power of DNNs.Theorem 1 (Convex equivalence for ReLU networks). Let X \u2208 Rn\xd7d be a data matrix and y \u2208 Rnthe associated scalar targets. The two-layer ReLU neural network can then be expressed as:hReLUW1,w2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)w2i,where W1 \u2208 Rm\xd7d, w2 \u2208 Rm are the weights of the first and second layers, m is the numberof hidden units, and ReLU(\xb7) is the ReLU activation. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 thatminimize the convex loss function Lconvex with a \u03bb-\u21132 regularization penalty can be obtained by firstsolving the following optimization problem:minv,uLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vi \u2212 ui), y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vi\u22252 + \u2225ui\u22252), s.t. vi, ui \u2208 Ki, (1)where sub-sampling is over neurons i \u2208 [m], DX = {D = diag(1 (Xu \u2265 0)) :u \u2208 Rd} is the set ofhyperplane arrangement patterns i.e. the set of activation patterns of neuron i in the hidden layer fora fixed X and Ki = {u \u2208 Rd : (2Di \u2212 I)Xu \u227d 0} is a convex cone; and setting{W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190SDi\u2208D\u2032 {(v\u22c6i , 1) :v\u22c6i \u0338= 0)} \u222a {(u\u22c6i , \u22121) :u\u22c6i \u0338= 0)}, \u2200k \u2208 [m], k > m\u22c6,(0, 0), otherwisefor some m\u22c6 s.t. m > m\u22c6 and m\u22c6 \u2264 n + 1.This leads to solving a practically intractable quadratic program for large d as |DX| \u2208 O(r(nr )r)where r = rank(X) \u2264 d < n. Instead, we solve an unconstrained version of the above problem:Theorem 2 (Convex equivalence for GReLU networks). Let G \u2282Rd and \u03d5g(X, u) =diag(1 (Xg \u22650))Xu denote the gated ReLU (GReLU) activation function. Then the modelhGReLUW1,w2 (X) =Xg\u2208G\u03d5g(XW1i)w2iis a GReLU network where each g is a fixed gate. Let gi \u2208 Rd such that diag(Xgi \u2265 0) = Diand G\u2032 = {gi : Di \u2208 DX}. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 for the regularized convex lossfunction can be obtained by solving the following convex optimization problem:minvLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiXvi, y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX\u2225vi\u22252, (2)and setting {W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190nvi\u22c6\u221a\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225,p\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225o\u2200i.The main difference between Theorem 2 and Theorem 1 is the activation function. Using fixedgates g, the activation function \u03d5g(X, W1i) is linear in W1i and the non-linearity introduced by thegating matrix is fixed with respect to the optimization variables W1 and w2. Since each term in theoptimization problem involves a product of \u03d5gi(XW1i) and w2i, it is bilinear in W1i and w2i. Atfirst glance, this may suggest that the optimization is non-convex as bilinear functions are generallynon-convex. However, in this specific case, we can transform the problem into a convex one throughreparameterization (specifically, set vi = W1iw2i). (For details, see Section A.1)One can show that the solutions to the optimization problems in Theorems 2 and 1 are guaranteedto approximate each other if the number of samples is sufficiently large. Kim and Pilanci (2024)show that under certain assumptions on the input data On/d \xb7 log nGaussian gates are sufficient4--- Page 5 ---for local gradient methods to converge with high probability to a stationary point that is O(\u221alog n)relative approximation of the global optimum of the non-convex problem. Lastly, note that the abovetheorems are hold only for scalar outputs, and by extension, binary classification problems. Mishkinet al. (2022) extend the above theorems to vector valued outputs by using a one-vs-all approach foreach entry in the output vector and the following reformulation:Theorem 3 (Convex equivalence for vector output networks). Let C be the model output dimension,Y \u2208 Rn\xd7C the associated targets, and W2 \u2208 RC\xd7m the weights of the second layer. Then,A. The two-layer ReLU neural network with vector output can be expressed as:hReLUW1,W2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)WT2i,and the optimal weights W\u22c61 and W\u22c62 can recovered by solving the following one-vs-all convexoptimization problem:min{vk,uk}Ck=1Lconvex CXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vik \u2212 uik)eTk , Y+ \u03bbCXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vik\u22252 + \u2225uik\u22252),(3)s.t. (2Di \u2212 In)Xvik \u227d 0, (2Di \u2212 In)Xuik \u227d 0. (4)B. The two-layer GReLU neural network with vector output and the corresponding convex optimiza-tion problem can be expressed similarly to the above except with the change thatPmi=1 ReLU(XW1i)is replaced by Pg\u2208G \u03d5g(XW1,i) in the statements and the constrained nuclear norm penalty beingreplaced with a standard nuclear norm penalty.Further, works by Gupta et al. (2021); Sahiner et al. (2021; 2022a;b) have extended this convexreformulation to modules prevalent in deep neural networks such as convolution layers, batchnormalization, self-attention transformers etc.4 Approach: Distillation via Activation Matching4.1 Distilling Vision Classification Models using Convex Networks.478.376 .169.263.674.456 .134 .223.122.326channel012r ow0 1 2.255 .231 .342.124.232.123.194 .202 .275 column012Input: xOutput: ymodel.Block1CNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL Umodel.Block2 model.Block3z xf S (z x )f T (z x )model.Block4T eacher (T)Student (S)model.f cF r o z en model la y ersDistilled la y ersoutput activ ationinput activ ationz xinput activ ationReL U+xReL UBatch norm3 x 3 Conv3 x 3 ConvBatch normFigure 1: For Resnet18 architecture, we first distill Block4 by training our convex block (orange) over input-output activations dataset. Post-training, we simply swap out the exisiting non-convex block and replace it withour convex block. Note that all other layers are kept frozen (marked in purple).Consider a Model M that has been trained on a dataset DTrain := {xTraini , yTraini }Ni=1 drawn from thedata distribution D. As discussed previously, one common way to compress the model size is toprune the architecture, say via magnitude thresholding, and get rid of redundant or non-contributingweights across the DNN layers. In our case, we will focus on compressing the upper blocks of themodel where each block itself can comprise of multiple layers of varying kinds such as Convolution,Batchnorm, Pooling, MLP, etc. We refer to the (original) block that we want to compress as Teacher(T ) and the post-distillation resulting block to be Student (S). We use these terms to conceptuallyrelate to the nomenclature prevalent in distillation literature.5--- Page 6 ---Let the set of input activations just before the Teacher block T generated by inferencing the M witha single pass over a dataset D \u223c Dbe {zx}. Let the output functions of T and S blocks be denotedby fT (\xb7) and fS(\xb7) respectively. Then we can distill the knowledge of T onto S by minimizing thefollowing activation matching objective:Ldistil = Ex,y\u223cDh\u2225fT (zx) \u2212 fS(zx)\u222522i, (5)i.e., we enforce the new block S to learn the input-output activation value mapping over the datadistribution. In practice however, we find the optimal weights of S by solving the following ERM:Ldistil(DTrain) =Xxi,yi\u2208DTrain\u2225fT (zxi) \u2212 fS(zxi)\u222522. (6)Once we have trained S with activation matching, we simply swap out T with S. Post replacement,we do not perform any fine-tuning of any other parameter of the model using the training dataset. Infact, all other layers in the model are kept frozen with their original weights and we directly performtest time inference (see Figure 4.1). Note how this approach is label free as there is no explicitdependency on the output y in the optimization problem. The only design constraint for S is that thedimensions of input-output of S should exactly match the dimensions for the input-output activationsof the original block T , i.e., dim(fS(\xb7)) =dim(fT (\xb7)).Unlike other distillation methods that preserve non-convexity our approach gets rid of any non-convexity in the constituent layers of S. For instance, consider Figure 4.1 where the number ofparameters in T increase significantly as we move from Block #1 to Block #4 ((see Table 4.1). Block#4 of Resnet18 alone contributes roughly 70% of the total model size and compressing it to \u2248 1/8-thits size compresses the overall model by60%. Each block in Resnet18 has multiple CNN, Batchnorm,AvgPool, and ReLU layers which results in sophisticated non-convex model with high expressivity.Table 1: Comparison of number of parameters in the 4 Blocks of Renset18 model. d and C denote the inputand output activation dimensions for each Block. The last two columns denote to what degree distilling a blocks(S) to a fixed parameter count compresses that particular block as well as the overall model.RESNET BLOCK INPUT DIM (d) OUTPUT DIM (C) #PARAMS(T) #PARAMS(S) SPARSITYBLOCK OVERALLBLOCK1 64\xd78 \xd78 64\xd78 \xd78 147,968 73,328 0.495 0.994BLOCK2 64\xd78 \xd78 128\xd74 \xd74 525,568 164,608 0.313 0.969BLOCK3 128\xd74 \xd74 256\xd72 \xd72 2,099,712 656,896 0.313 0.8765BLOCK4 256\xd72 \xd72 512\xd71 \xd71 8,393,728 1,312,768 0.156 0.394.We now describe how to construct a convexS. Note that AvgPool is a linear operator and thereforepreserves convexity. Furthermore, training regularized ReLU networks with Batchnorm can bereformulated as a finite-dimensional convex problem (Ergen et al., 2022b). Therefore, a compositionof these operations is still a convex operation. Now, the non-convexity ofT stems primarily from thecomposition of multiple ReLU layers inside the block. Consider the simplified functional expressionof the teacher module where we omit all the Batchnorm and AvgPool layers, fT (zx) = t\u25e6k(zx),wheret(z) =CNN2ReLU(CNN1(z)), (7)i.e., T is the composition of k smaller 2-CNN layer ReLU networks (t(\xb7)) and k is a fixed numberthat depends on actual the model architecture.To distill this via convex models, we will setS to be a 3-CNN layer block such that:fS(zx) =CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 1 (CNN1(zx) > 0). (8)Remarks on the convexity ofS: In Sahiner et al., it is shown that the above architecture corresponds tothe Burer-Monteiro factorization of the convex NN objective in equation 4 for vector outputs, and alllocal minima are globally optimal (see Theorem 3.3 in Sahiner et al.). Also note (i) 1 (CNN1(z) > 0)is a boolean mask that masks out the corresponding entries in the outputs ofCNN2(z). Since the maskvalues are {0, 1}, no gradient is back-propagated to the parameters of CNN1, it does not contributeany effective parameter to the model size. Alternatively, we can mask out CNN2(z) using fixedboolean masks. (ii) CNN2(z) is the main output generating layer. iii) CNN1\xd713 is 1 \xd7 1 filter whichis used to ensure that the shapes of fT (zx) and sT (zx) match. Observe that it was not necessaryfor S in this example to be composed of CNN layers. In fact, any block that matches input-outputactivation dimensions, irrespective of the architecture design, could have been used.6--- Page 7 ---4.2 Accelerating Distillation using Convex SolversIn the previous subsection, we discussed how one can compress a large model by distilling its largenon-convex modules into smaller convex modules. When the optimization problem is convex, saddlepoints and non- global minima do not exist, facilitating faster convergence even with momentum-basedoptimization methods (Assran and Rabbat, 2020). Therefore, convex formulations can acceleratethe test-time fine-tuning of the compressed model in presence of new data when compared to theirnon-convex counterparts. To push these benefits to the limit, we employ fast convex solvers.Given that the only constraint on S is matching the shape of the input-output activations with T , wedraw inspiration from the work of Mishkin et al. (2022) on 2-layer convex and non-convex MLPmodels, and setup S as a 2-layer GReLU MLP along the lines of Theorems 2 and 3. While wedemonstrate the effects of convexity when using standard optimtizers like Adam (Paszke et al., 2019)to train S, solving the resulting group lasso regression can be more efficiently handled by specializedconvex optimization algorithms. The SCNN Python library 1 provides fast and reliable algorithms forconvex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Specifically, itimplements the R-FISTA algorithm, an improved version of the FISTA algorithm (Beck and Teboulle,2009), which combines line search, careful step-size initialization, and data normalization to enhanceconvergence. We utilized R-FISTA as the convex solver in this paper.4.3 Improving Convex Solvers Via PolishingW 1 1 W 2 1 W 2 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 2 Figure 2: To improve SCNN\u2019s one-vs-all solution, we freezeW\u22c61 but recompute W\u22c62 for equation 6 by enforcing informa-tion sharing (red lines) across the constituent W1i\u2019s.While the SCNN package is optimized forscalar outputs, it handles vector output op-timization problems by adopting a one-vs-all approach for each output dimension, i.e.return WT2 \u2190 [w21, w22, . . . ,w2C]m\xd7Cwhere each w2i \u2208 Rm. This inhibits anyinformation sharing between the weightmatrices corresponding to different nodesin the multi-dimensional model output. Toovercome this, we can explicitly impose in-formation sharing between the weight ma-trices w2js, and in the process arguablyobtain a better solution for W2 an evensparse solution for W1, leading to possi-bility of further model compression. Oneway to do this is to freeze the stacked W1matrices computed by SCNN and recompute W\u22c62 (initialized with W2 obtained from SCNN) butwith a group elastic constraint on rows of W2 (See Appendix A.2 for the mathematical setup). Usinga group elastic constraint on the "shared" W2 regressor encourages using features from differentW1\u2019s and therefore acts as a feature selector. This essentially translates to zeroing-out entire columnsof W1 and compress the model further. To implement this, we use the open source python packageAdelie2 that can solve the group elastic regression problem in a heavily parallelized manner.5 ExperimentsIn this section, we conduct an empirical study with the following goals: a) to demonstrate that usingconvex neural networks and distilling via convex optimization performs as well, if not better than,non-convex distillation; and b) to show that our approach generalizes well in low-sample regimeand that using convex solvers is an order of magnitude faster than training non-convex models. Weconsider the following baselines: 1) Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT) : The original full fine-tunedmodel (T ) undergoing compression, 2) Convex-Gated (Sconvex): learns a compressed block withconvex-gating activations, 3)Non-Convex (Snon-convex) learns a non-convex compressed block withReLU activation, and 4) Pruning (Sprune): prunes the weights in T . We set the compressed blocksSnon-convex and Sprune s.t. they have the same parameter count as in Sconvex. This enables a fairperformance comparison between each of the distillation methods. We use SVHN (Netzer et al.,2011), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009), TinyImagenet (Le and Yang, 2015), and VisualWake Words (Chowdhery et al., 2019) datasets to establish the validity of our approach.1https://pypi.org/project/pyscnn/2https://jamesyang007.github.io/adelie/index.html7--- Page 8 ---5.1 Convex Distillation of CNN Blocks using standard optimizersFirst, we measure the performance of KD based compressed blocks, as described in Section 4.1, bycomparing the effects of convexity and non-convexity in the design ofS:Snon-convex = CNN2ReLU(CNN1(zx)), Sconvex = CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 (CNN1(zx) > 0),and optimizing the Mean Squared Error as Lconvex in equation 6 using Adam Optimizer. For bothmethods, we incorporate BatchNorm and AvgPool layers in the architecture since they preserveconvexity and lead to improved results. To obtain different compression rates when distilling theblocks (reported as X times the original model size), we vary the number of filters of CNN2 in Sconvexfrom 1 to 512 in multiples of 2. Then, for a fair comparison, we adjust the number of filters inthe CNN layers of Snon-convex to match the parameter count of Sconvex. Since CNN1 provides only aboolean mask and has no gradient back-propagated to it, and CNN3 is a 1 \xd7 1 convolution layer,typically for the same number of filters, #\u03b8non-convex \u2248 2 \xd7 #\u03b8convex.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Renset18 on SVHN: 10-Way ClassificationOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation (Snon convex)(a) Test Accuracies on the SVHN dataset when com-pressing only the fourth CNN block.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Resent18 CIFAR10 with 100 Train Samples/ClassOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)(b) Full Test Set Accuracies when given only 100training samples per class in CIFAR10,Figure 3: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex performance comparisons in low-sample and high compression regimes.Figure 3a demonstrates the test-set accuracy versus total model size as we double the number offilters in the compressed Block 4 of ResNet-18 on the SVHN dataset. Note that in the extremelylow model size regime (number of filters = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), Sconvex significantly outperforms Snon-convex.On the CIFAR10 dataset, we also compress Block 3 along with Block 4 of Resnet18 by varying thenumber of filters in multiples of 2 from 1 to 512. We compare the performance of both Sconvex andSnon-convex against magnitude-based pruning, where we preserve a certain percentage of weights basedon their magnitude and zero out the remaining entries in the weight matrices. We then swap differentcombinations of the compressed versions of Blocks 3 and 4 into the original model.0.82 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlock 3 Convex DistillationBlock 3 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 3 Vanilla Pruning Distillation0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlock 4 Convex DistillationBlock 4 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 4 Vanilla Pruning Distillation0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlocks 3+4 Convex DistillationBlocks 3+4 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 3+4 Vanilla Pruning DistillationAccuracy vs Compression for CIFAR10: 10-Way ClassificationFigure 4: Performance comparisons of all three distillation methods on Blocks 3, 4, and their combinations, ofthe Resnet18 model on CIFAR10. The Black dotted line denotes the original fine-tuned model\u2019s performance onCIFAR10. In the leftmost subplot, we distill only Block 3, in the middle subplot only Block 4, and in the rightsubplot, we plug and play different combinations of the compressed blocks into the original model.Figure 4 demonstrates the efficacy of our Sconvex v/s Snon-convex on CIFAR10 dataset. All subplotscompare the test set accuracies without any post-compression training or fine-tuning on the labeleddataset. Note that utilizing the compressed versions for both Blocks 3 and 4 leads to \u223c10x compres-sion compared to the original fine-tuned model in size, with no significant drop in performance on the8--- Page 9 ---full test set. The figure shows that while both Sconvex and Snon-convex perform well when distilling onlyBlock 3, Sconvex outperforms Snon-convex when distilling Block 4, especially at higher compressionrates. This becomes more evident as we use different compressed combinations of both Blocks 3 & 4.Next, we consider the performance of Sconvex and Snon-convex in the low-sample regime. We train bothSconvex and Snon-convex (compressing Block 4) using only 100 randomly selected training samples perclass and compare their performance on the full dataset (\u223c 25K samples) against the Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on original training dataset. Figure 3b shows that performance gap between Sconvex andSnon-convex is even more prominent in this data-scarce regime.So far, we have used the Adam optimizer to train both the convex and non-convex compressed blocksin these experiments. In the subsequent experiments, we leverage fast convex solvers for distillation.5.2 Fast Distillation Using Convex Solvers10 2 10 1 100Time (seconds)0.500.550.600.650.700.750.80T est AccuracyDifferent Optimization Routines distilling Resnet18 for TinyImagenetOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Augmented Lagrangian (AL) for (Sconvex)RFISTA (Sconvex)Approx.

We use the SCNN library to solve theactivation-matching problem for Sconvex and theAdam optimizer for the Snon-convex block. Thetime budget for Adam is set slightly higher thanthat used by SCNN for a fair comparison. Recallthat having a convex optimization problem forSconvex gives us the liberty to choose any convexsolver, which requires minimal hand-tuning ofhyperparameters. Figure 5 compares differentconvex solvers when distilling a Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on a binary classification task in theTinyImageNet Dataset (german shephard v/s tabby cat) into Sconvex perform at test time. In thisDataset, we have 500 training and 100 test samples per class, representing a data-scarce regime. Fordistilling to Snon-convex, we use both full-batch and mini-batch training using Adam. The experimentis repeated over 10 different seeds, and we plot the error curves for each method, with the solidline representing the mean and the shaded region indicating twice the standard deviation. The plotshows that RFISTA and Approximate Cone Decomposition are superior among the convex solvers.In contrast, both versions of Adam-trained non-convex models take nearly one-two orders of moretime to reach the performance achieved by the convex solvers.0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05Time (seconds)2030405060708090T est Accuracy2.1M2.0M 1.9M 1.8M 1.6M 1.4M1.2M 1.0MOnly 1 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.5M1.8M 1.8M 1.7M 1.7M 1.6M 1.5M 1.3M 1.2M 1.1M 0.9MOnly 10 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.3M1.3M1.3M 1.3M 1.2M 1.2M 1.2MOnly 25 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)Regularization Path Acc for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 6: As we vary the number of training samples per class, we see that in extremely resource-constrainedsettings convex distillation does much better than non-convex distillation on the test set.Since SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem for vector outputs, for the 10-way classification problemof CIFAR10, we set the hidden dimension of the network to be 25, determine the total number ofnon-zero entries in the weight matrices computed by SCNN (using the RFISTA solver) and use thatto set the hidden layer size of the non-convex block. For an elaborate comparison between the twomethods, at each point of the regularization path computed by SCNN, we track the the time requiredby it to solve the activation matching problem and use that as a time budget for the Adam-basedSnon-convex training. We also impose constraints on the available number of training samples and report9--- Page 10 ---the test set accuracy of each method after swapping the distilled blocks back into the original model.Figure 6 shows the experiment results when we try to distill Block 4 from it\u2019s original 8M parametercount to \u223c1M at different training samples/class configurations. Note how in extreme labeled trainingdata scarce settings, convex distillation performs far better than non-convex distillation.5.3 Distillation via Proximal Gradient Methods followed by polishingOne may notice in Figure 6 that as we relax the constraints on the training time and the number oftraining samples available per class, non-convex NN seems to catch up to convex NN distillation.20 40 60 80 100#TrainSamples/Class76788082848688Complete T est Set AccuracyConvex AccNon-Convex AccFFT Accuracy @ #params = 8393728SCNN+Adelie+Polish for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 7: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex Test Accuracies when givenonly 100 training samples per class for activation matchingOne key reason is that SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem which inhibits any infor-mation sharing between the weight matri-ces corresponding to different nodes in themulti-dimensional model output. To over-come this, we recompute W\u22c62 by explic-itly imposing information sharing betweenthe constituent weight matrices (See Sec-tion 4.3). By obtaining a shared W2, werecover any performance lost due to ad-ditional compression by polishing and re-solving a regularized linear regression prob-lem. Figure 7 shows that even for relaxedresource constraints, convex optimizationbased distillation performs at least as good as with Adam-based non-convex block distillation. We be-lieve that here convex distillation approach would outperform non-convex distillation ifS comprisedof CNN layers instead of linear layers. Since SCNN only solves the training of 2-layer MLPs, we areconstrained by the types of experiments we can do.5.4 Beyond Distillation: End-To-End Fine-tuning of Convex ArchitecturesTable 2: Convex vs. Non-Convex: Visual Wake WordsBack-Bone Classification Head AccuracyFrozen Convex 81.36Frozen Non-Convex 80.84Trainable Convex 83.47Trainable Non-Convex 83.42As an ablation experiment, we study how con-vexity affects the fine-tuning of DNNs on la-beled training datasets. Visual Wake Words isa benchmark dataset derived from COCO Linet al. (2015) that assesses the performance oftiny vision models at the microcontroller scale(memory footprint of less than 250KB). For ourexperiment, we consider the Person/Not Persontask, where the vision model determines whethera person is present in the image. There are a total of \u223c115K images in the training and validationdataset \u223c 8k images in the test dataset. This task serves various edge machine learning use cases,such as in smart homes and retail stores, where we wish to detect the presence of specific objects ofinterest without a high inference cost. Using the ImageNet pre-trained MobileNet V3 model (Howardet al., 2019) as our base model, we preserve its back-bone upto the fourth layer and replace all thesubsequent layers with a smaller architecture as the classification head. The classification head canbe either convex or non-convex, as described in the previous experiments. We also consider scenarioswhere the back-bone is either kept frozen or trainable. We then fine-tune the resulting model on theCOCO dataset with Adam on Cross-Entropy Loss, and report the Test Accuracy in Table 2.When the back-bone is frozen, convex classification head performs noticeably better than its non-convex counterpart. This scenario represents a realistic situation where end-to-end fine-tuning of largemodels (e.g., large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs)) can be prohibitivelyexpensive for downstream tasks due to computational constraints. When the back-bone is trainable,i.e. all the parameters of the combined model can be updated during fine-tuning, using a convex headis very slightly better or nearly the same as a non-convex head. This experiment shows promise thatconvex NN architectures are good candidates for DNN applications beyond just distillation.6 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have introduced a novel approach that bridges the non-convex and convex regimesby combining the representational power of large non-convex DNNs with the favorable optimizationlandscape of convex NNs. Our experiments show that the disillation via convex architectures performs10--- Page 11 ---at least as good as prevalent non-convex distillation methods. Furthermore, our approach successfullydistill models in a completely label-free setting without requiring any post-compression fine-tuningon the training data. This work opens new avenues for deploying efficient, low-footprint modelson resource-constrained edge devices with on-device learning using online data. Future work couldfocus on developing convex optimization methods to directly solve for optimal weights withoutresorting to a one-vs-all setting for multi-dimensional outputs. Additionally, exploring applicationsin other domains, such as natural language processing and generative models, could further validateand expand the applicability of our approach.ReferencesWaseem Rawat and Zenghui Wang.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance. We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers. On Pixel 4's Edge TPU, these models improve the\naccuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA mobile models.\nPublication Date: 2020-03-05\narXiv paper ID: 2003.02838v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA.

Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #20, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layerand Block Pruning with Latency ConstraintXinglong Sun1,2\u22c6, Barath Lakshmanan1, Maying Shen1, Shiyi Lan1, JingdeChen1, and Jose Alvarez11 NVIDIA2 Stanford University{xinglongs, blakshmanan, mshen, shiyil, joshchen, josea}@nvidia.com2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1EagleEye (ECCV'20)MetaPruning (ICCV'19)AutoSlim (NeurIPS'19)0.50 x ResNet50ResNet18HALP (NeurIPS'22)SMCP (ECCV'22)Ours+4.2Top1+ 426FPS+ 1161 FPS +2.1mAP+5.6 FPSFig. 1:MDP exhibits Pareto dominance across different tasks.

In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-artby pruning StreamPETR [60] at a45% pruning ratio, achieving higherFPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.Keywords: Network Pruning, Model Acceleration, MINLP.1 IntroductionDeep neural networks have become the de-facto standards of advanced com-puter vision applications, ranging from image classification [25] to object de-tection [43] and segmentation [46]. Contemporary networks [15,60,65] usuallyconsist of both convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractorsand transformer blocks to capture global cues. As the performance advances,the models swell in size correspondingly, containing millions or even billions ofparameters [33]. This growth in model size presents challenges for deploymenton resource-constrained edge devices, hinders real-time inference tasks such asautonomous driving, and incurs significant costs for training and inference oncloud systems. Pruning [23,50,54], which involves removing redundant parame-ters from the network, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the modelcomputation and size to reach real-time requirements without significantly com-promising its accuracy. To keep pace with the ever-expanding model sizes, weneed very aggressive pruningtechniques to significantly reduce latency for effi-cient and real-time model deployment.Channel pruning [31,38,39,50,52\u201354,59], in particular, has garnered signif-icant attention as an effective pruning technique to reduce model computation,usually 30% - 50%, practically without requiring changes in the hardware. Chan-nel pruning involves removing redundant convolution filters identified by someimportance criterion [39,40,50], usually starting from a pre-trained model. De-spite advancements, these methods have two critical limitations. First, channelpruning methods are confined to pruning on the channel level, while we cannot avoid the structural removal of entire blocks or layers to achieve the largerpruning ratios required (70%-90%). Only a few works [11,19,58,61,62,64] ad-dress layer or block pruning. These methods can provide greater accelerationthan channel pruning, but they are restricted to pruning at the layer or blockgranularity and cannot simultaneously introduce channel sparsity, resulting insuboptimal accuracy.Second, current pruning approaches to directly reduce inference latency uselatency models that only account for variations in output channel count at eachlayer, ignoring the simultaneous impact of pruning on input channels [10,13,31,34,49,52,54,66]. This inaccurate latency estimation leads to sub-optimaltrade-offs between accuracy and latency, especially at the larger pruning ratiosrequired for inference on the edge. With large pruning ratios, guiding pruningtoward an optimal structure becomes more challenging while adhering closely tothe desired latency without precise modeling.--- Page 3 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 3INPUTCONV + RELUPOOLING2x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 1BlockDecisionVariableLayerChannel Variable1 \U0001d49a\U0001d7cf1\U0001d467"\u2208{0,1} 2 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d03 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d12\U0001d467%\u2208{0,1}4 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d25 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d36 \U0001d49a\U0001d7d4\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u20260.040.070.120.170.080.110.180.20.110.150.210.230.160.190.240.280.180.240.290.32latency cost matrixMINLP Solver layerschannelsExtract Pruned Subnetwork3x (CONV + RELU) Residual Block 2\u2026Pretrained Model\u201ccat\u201d\u0398\U0001d458\U0001d458\U0001d48e\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7d2\U0001d48e\U0001d7d0=\U0001d7d3Zoomed-in Layer 3\u0398!\u2208\U0001d445"\xd7$\xd7%\xd7%0.91.30.20.5ChannelImportance0.91.30.20.5Sorting1.32.22.72.9LayerImportanceCompute Layer ImportanceScore every possible channel count$\U0001d43c!Output Channel Count Input Channel Count \U0001d436!Compute LatencyCapture both in. and out. dims. changesBlock Grouping\U0001d466+,=1\U0001d466--=1\U0001d466.,\U0001d466/,\U0001d4660:\U0001d45b/\U0001d44e\U0001d466,+=1argmax\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5(\U0001d466!'\u22c5$\U0001d43c!)+\u2026s.t.\u2026+\U0001d467&\u22c5\U0001d466!\u22c5\U0001d466('\u22c5\U0001d436!+\u22ef\u2264\u03a8MINLP Formulation w/Latency and Importance Expression of Layer 3\U0001d467,=1 \U0001d467+=0 blocksFinetuningTopK&SumOne-hot Vector0 10 0Eg.\U0001d49a\U0001d7d1\U0001d7d1=\U0001d7cf: Keep 3Output Channels at Layer 3Fig. 2:Paradigm of our proposed method MDP. We start by computing layer im-portance and constructing latency cost matrices for each layer. We then group layerswithin the same block and solve an MINLP to optimize pruning decisions at bothchannel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnetwork and finetune it.This paper presents a novel pruning framework that effectively overcomes thelimitations of existing methods. Specifically, we do not model channels or layersseparately. Instead, we first group channels and layers within the same block inour formulation, allowing them to be handled jointly in the optimization process.This unified approach seamlessly integrates channel, layer, and block pruning,enabling us to identify the optimal pruned structure at all levels efficiently. Sec-ond, for accurate modeling of latency in different configurations at each layer,we propose the concept ofbilayer configuration latency, which considers simul-taneous variations in both input and output channel counts across all layers.To incorporate these two strategies, we reformulate pruning as a Mixed-IntegerNonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]. This allows us to directly solve for theoptimal pruned structure adhering to a specific latency budget with only a singlepass. As a result, our framework enhances pruning performance with significantlatency reductions. All together, we refer to our method asMulti-DimensionalPruning (MDP).Our code will be provided upon acceptance.Our extensive experiments, with a glimpse showcased in Figure 1, validateour method\u2019s superior performance, particularlyat high pruning ratios. In clas-sification with an aggressive85% pruning ratio, we significantly outperform theprevious work, HALP [54], with a speed increase of +1161 im/s and an accuracyimprovement of +1.4. For 3D object detection, we prune the StreamPETR [60]model comprising of a CNN feature extractor and transformer based decoder.We establish a new state-of-the-art at a45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS(37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline. At a largerpruning ratio of70%, we significantly outpace HALP [54] in both FPS (43.3 vs.42.5) and mAP (0.394 vs. 0.373). We summarize our contributions as follows:\u2013 We introduce ablock groupingstrategy for simultaneous channel and blockpruning, allowing collective decision-making in optimization.\u2013 We propose a method to accurately formulate latency for different layerconfigurations, capturing variations in both input and output channels.--- Page 4 ---4 X.Sun et al.\u2013 We organically combine the above strategies with a novel pruning frameworkredefining pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) whichdirectly solves a globally optimal pruned structure within specific latencyconstraints efficiently with a single-pass.\u2013 We conduct extensive experiments and observe state-of-the-art accuracy-latency trade-offs in a wide range of settings, covering (a) ImageNet [16] forclassification, Pascal VOC [20] for 2D detection, and Nuscenes [9] for 3Ddetection (b) with three model architectures: ResNet-50 [25], SSD [43], andStreamPETR [60] (c) across various latency reduction pruning ratios.2 Related WorksOurworkcanbecategorizedasapruningmethodingeneral.Wewillnowprovidea brief overview of the field and highlight our differences from the previousapproaches. Pruning methods [1,23,24,36,39,40,48,50,54,56] mostly designimportance criterion to rank parameters and remove the lowest-ranked ones,followed by an additional finetuning for accuracy recovery.Channel Pruning Some pruning methods [14,26\u201328,31,39,40,50,54,57,67]operate under structural constraints, for example removing convolutional chan-nels [39] from CNNs, thus enjoy immediate performance improvement withoutspecialized hardware or library support. Exemplary channel importance criterionrelied on metrics like weight norm [14,26,27,39,67], Taylor expansion [41,50,68],geometric median [28], and feature maps rank [40]. Our method leverages theTaylor [50] channel importance criterion but extend it to evaluate the configu-rations of entire layers and blocks, going beyond just pruning channel but alsocombining layer and block removals.Layer and Block PruningChannel pruning methods have been effective inreducing performance loss while removing a moderate number of parameters.However, their effectiveness is limited when it comes to more extensive pruning.This is because they focus only on removing channels, but to achieve optimalresults with significant pruning, it becomes necessary to remove entire layers orblocks. Only a limited number of works [11,19,58,61,62,64] focus on pruninglayers and blocks. [12] and [19] employ intermediate features at each layer tocompute a layer ranking score with linear classifier probes [12] or imprinting [19]and remove the lowest ranked layers. [61] introduces linear classifier probe aftereach block to check performance and remove blocks with the smallest improve-ments from the previous. Recent method [62] also studies individually removingeach block and calculating importance based on the performance drop.Though shown to provide larger speedups than channel pruning, all of theseapproaches [11,19,58,61,62,64] only operate at the layer or block granularityand fail if we want to introduce channel sparsity simultaneously. Additionally,some add extra module or parameters like linear probes [12,61] that requireadditional training and complicate the process. Our methodseamlessly uniteschannel and block pruning, which allows us to efficiently determine an optimalpruned structure at both the channel and block levels with just a single pass onthe pre-trained model, without any need for extra training or parameters.--- Page 5 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 5Hardware-aware Pruning Since parameter compression ratio does not di-rectly translate into computation reduction ratio, some works [38,63,67] focusprimarily on reducing model FLOPs. Latest methods go one step further andperform hardware-aware pruning which aims to directly reduce the hardwareinference latency. The representative work HALP [54] first prepares a latencylookup table for all configurations of prunable parameters measured on the tar-get hardware then formulate pruning as a knapsack problem [55], maximizingtotal parameter importance while constraining the total associated latency un-der a given budget. [52] later demonstrates that HALP can be applied to au-tonomous systems to achieve real-time detection performance. To enhance thelearning capacity of pruned models, SMCP [31] introduces soft masking withinthe HALP framework, enabling the reconsideration of earlier pruned weights inan iterative pruning setting.Although these methods [31,52,54] have made notable progress in accuracyand speed, their reliance on an inaccurate latency estimation leads to subopti-mal accuracy-latency trade-offs. They account for changes in output channelsbut overlook simultaneous variations in input channels caused by pruning thepreceding layer. This issue is more pronounced when aiming for large latencyreductions, as it becomes more challenging to guide pruning to meet the desiredlatency budget without accurate latency modeling. In our work, we also focuson hardware-aware pruningbut introduce a more accurate latency modeling tech-nique that accounts for simultaneous variations in both input and output channelcounts across all layers, allowing us to determine optimal configurations globally.Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) [6,7,37]As our strategiesof block pruning and accurate latency modeling are unified with a MINLP for-mulation, we will briefly introduce the field. Formally defined in [37], MINLPsare optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables, where theobjective and constraints are nonlinear functions. Effectively and efficiently solv-ing MINLP [3\u20135,17,18,21,22] is a critical area in optimization research, with keycomponent often involving decomposing the problem into Mixed-Integer LinearPrograms (MILP) and Nonlinear Programs (NLP). Recently, conveniently mod-eling and solving MINLPs in Python has been made possible with Pyomo [8]and MindtPy [2]. In this paper, we use the Outer Approximation (OA) [17,21]method with Pyomo [8] and MindtPy [2] to solve our pruning MINLP.3 MethodologyWe will now present our pruning framework. We begin by establishing prelimi-naries, defining our goals and declaring relevant notations. We then describe ourproposed pruning formulation in detail.PreliminariesFortheneuralnetworkwith L convolutionlayersintotal,werep-resent the convolution parameters as\u0398 = SLl=1 \u0398l, s.t.\u0398l \u2208 Rml\xd7ml\u22121\xd7Kl\xd7Kl ,where ml, ml\u22121, Kl denote the number of output channels, input channels, andkernel size at layerl respectively. Following [25,47], a block is defined as the setof layers(e.g. bottleneck [25]) skipped by a residual connection. Suppose there is--- Page 6 ---6 X.Sun et al.a total ofB blocks in the network\u0398.

If thebth block is pruned (i.e.zb = 0), all layers in this block(\u03b2(l) =b) are removed, regardless of the value ofyl. In this case, the channel count becomes0.The layer channel variablesy and block decision variablesz describe thepruning decisions and encode the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398, and they are our targetsto jointly optimize. In the following sections, we will describe how to solve thembased on information we collected from the pre-trained network\u0398.3.1 Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP)To understand how performant a pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 is, following previousworks [31,39,40,50,54], we leverage importance score as a proxy. The optimalsubnetwork \u02c6\u0398 is considered to be the one that maximizes the importance scorewhile closely adhering to the latency constraint\u03a8. With large latency reductionfrom the original model\u0398, we need to consider potential removal of layers andblocks while guiding the pruning decisions with accurate latency estimations.To identify this optimal subnetwork encoded by layer channel variables (y) andblock decision variables (z), we begin by defining two key components, the im-portance score for different values ofy and z and accurate latency estimationfor these varying configurations, for each individual layer. The final objective isthe aggregation of these components across all layers of the model.Next, to seamlessly combine complete layer and block removal with channelsparsity, we perform ablock groupingstep which groups the latency and impor-tance expression for all layers within the same block under a single block decisionvariable. We then formulate the above as aMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program-ming (MINLP)to jointly determiney and z for an optimal pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 at both the channel and block levels. Finally, we extract the pruned subnet-work structure \u02c6\u0398 from the solver\u2019s output ofy and z and carry out a finetuningsession on \u02c6\u0398 for E epochs to recover the accuracy. All together, we refer to ourmethod as Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP). A paradigm diagram of MDPis demonstrated in Fig. 2. We are now going to describe the details of each step.Layer Importance ComputationAs discussed in Sec.2, the quality of thepruned subnetworks could be conveniently assessed with channel importance--- Page 7 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 7scores. With Taylor importance score [50], the importance of thejth channel atlayer l can be computed as:Ijl = |g\u03b3jl\u03b3jl + g\u03b2jl\u03b2jl |, (1)where \u03b3 and \u03b2 are BatchNorm layer\u2019s weight and bias for the correspondingchannel, andg\u03b3 and g\u03b2 are the gradients.As the number of channels kept in a layerl is directly encoded by the one-hot variablesyl, we associate an importance score for each possible configurationyl could take, with the one-hot bit index ranging from1 to ml. We leverage agreedy approach to derive this. For example, if at layerl pruning keepsi channels(i.e. yil = 1), we would like thesei channels to be the top-i most important.Therefore, we first rank individual channel importance scoresIl at layer l inascending order. Then to compute layer importance score\u02c6Iil corresponding toyl with yil = 1, we aggregate thei highest channel importance scores.Formally, this is expressed as:\u02c6Iil =XTop-i(Il), \u2200i \u2208 [1, ml] (2)The vector\u02c6Il \u2208 Rml fully describes the importance scores for all possible numberof channels layerl could take from1 to ml. We thereby define theimportance atlayer l for a specific configurationyl as a simple dot-product:yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il.Latency ModelingIn order to accurately guide our pruning, we fully describethe latency variations with respect to both the number of its output and inputchannels and construct a latency cost matrixCl for each convolution layerl asfollows:Cl =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0Tl(1, 1) Tl(1, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(1, ml)Tl(2, 1) Tl(2, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(2, ml)...... ... ...Tl(ml\u22121, 1) Tl(ml\u22121, 2) \xb7\xb7\xb7 Tl(ml\u22121, ml)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (3)Here, Tl is a pre-built latency lookup table, which could be measured on thetarget hardware beforehand as prior works [31,52,54], andTl(i, j) returns thelatency of layerl with i input channels andj output channels, upper-bounded bythe total channel countml\u22121 and ml in \u0398. Cl enumerates latency correspondingtoallpossibilitieslayer l couldbe,varyingtheinputandoutputchannelnumbers.With these configurations encoded in the one-hot layer channel variablesyl\u22121and yl, we define thebilayer configuration latencyat layerl for specificyl\u22121 andyl simply as two dot-products:yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl).We can observe that eachyl appears twice in the expressions, once at com-puting latency for layerl, and once at layerl+1. While this poses some challengesin optimization, it manages to accurately capture the full overall latency land-scape of network. This approach enables us to guide the pruning process withmore precise latency estimations, significantly improving the precision from pre-vious methods [31,52,54] that did not consider the simultaneous contributionsfrom both output and input channel dimension.--- Page 8 ---8 X.Sun et al.Block GroupingNotice that we define the layer channel variablesyl to onlydescribechannelcountfrom 1 toml,excludingthecasewhenpruningremovesallchannels from layerl(i.e. channel count of0). This means if we only use variablesy to represent the pruned model\u02c6\u0398, we cannot represent completely removinga layer from the network; at best, we can reduce it to just one channel, similarto previous methods [31,52,54]. This is intentional because arbitrarily pruninga single layer could easily lead to network disconnection, causing discontinuityin the information flow of the network. However, residual blocks are inherentlyresilient to removal of all their internal layers at once, as the skip connectionallows information to bypass the removed layers, preserving gradient flow.To handle the removal of an entire residual block structure, we introduceblock grouping where layers are grouped into the block it belongs to. Specifically,we parse the network architecture to obtain thelayer2block mapping \u03b2(l) forevery layerl. Then we group all importance and latency expressions within thesame block under a single block decision variable. If pruning decides to removethe bth block, the importance and latency contributions from all layers withinthat block, where\u03b2(l) =b, should be simultaneously set to0.We model this group decision with the binary block decision variableszb.Subsequently, for each layerl, we first determine whether its associated blockdecision variable, denoted byz\u03b2(l), is active (z\u03b2(l) = 1). Only if it is active, weevaluate the layer importance and latency expressions determined byy; other-wise, they are simply zeroed. Theimportancefor layerl is determined by bothyland z\u03b2(l), and can be expressed asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il). Similarly, thebilayer configu-ration latencyat convolution layerl can be represented asz\u03b2(l) \xb7(yl\xb7(yl\u22121\u22a4\xb7Cl)).Block removal is properly handled by giving the block decision variableszshigher \u2019priority\u2019 than the layer channel variablesys. For example, deactivatingz1 results in the exclusion of all layers within the first block(where\u03b2(l) = 1) bysimultaneously setting their importance and latency expressions to0, regardlessof the values taken by theiryls. Also, notice that for thelayers that do not belongto any block structures, their correspondingzs are simply always1.Solve MINLPWe aim to jointly determine the optimal layer channel and blockdecisions(y andz)thatmaximizethesummationoftheir importance scoreswhileensuring the cumulativebilayer configuration latencyremains below the budget\u03a8. Formally, this can be represented with the following Mixed-Integer NonlinearProgramming (MINLP) formulation:arg maxy,zLXl=1z\u03b2(l) \xb7 (yl\u22a4 \xb7 \u02c6Il) (4)s.t.LXl=1z\u03b2(l)\xb7(yl \xb7 (yl\u22121\u22a4 \xb7 Cl)) \u2264 \u03a8We restrict all decision variablesy and z to binary values, while the layerimportances \u02c6Il and latency cost matricesCl contain floating-point numbers,hence making the program mixed-integer in nature.

Since we jointly optimize all variables, we candirectly determine a globally optimal set ofy and z with only a single pass.Extract Pruned StructureOnce we solved the MINLP program 4, we proceedto extract the pruned subnetwork\u02c6\u0398 based on the variablesy and z determinedby the solver. If block decision variablezb is set to0 for a particular blockb,we completely remove that block in\u02c6\u0398 and disregard the solver\u2019s output for thelayer channel variables(yl) of the layers within that block (where\u03b2(l) =b). Onthe other hand, if the block is active withzb = 1and the solver returns the valueof y with yil = 1, we keepi channels in \u02c6\u0398 at layerl according to ArgTopK(Il, i),mapping layer importance\u02c6Il in Eqn.2 back to thei top-performing channels.In practice, since the layer importances\u02c6I are built from Taylor score [50] mea-sured using gradient information from data batches, we perform pruning afterone epoch when the model has seen all of the samples in the dataset and accumu-late their importance estimation. After pruning, we finetune the pruned model\u02c6\u0398 for a duration ofE epochs to recover accuracy. An algorithmic description ofthe above process is provided in Algorithm 1.--- Page 10 ---10 X.Sun et al.4 ExperimentsTo validate the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments across acomprehensive set of scenarios. We demonstrate our pruning results on 3 tasks:image classification with ImageNet [16] and ResNet50 [25], 2D object detectionwith Pascal VOC [20] and SSD [43], and 3D object detection with Nuscenes [9]and StreamPETR [60].Our method improves upon previous approaches by providing(a)more accu-rate latency estimation and(b) the ability to handle the removal of entire layerand block structures. These improvements are reflected in our superior result,as we achieve a new state-of-the-art with a significantly better accuracy-latencytrade-off compared to prior arts [31,54] and other competitive baselines [38,59],especially at higher pruning ratios. To provide a comprehensive understanding ofour proposed pruning framework, we also conducted an in-depth ablation study,highlighting the individual contribution of our improvement from(a) and (b).Settings For ResNet50 and SSD, we aimed to optimize their inference latencyon the Nvidia TITAN V GPU with batch size of256. When pruning Stream-PETR [60], we adapted our approach to target the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090GPU batch size of1, aligning with the focus of StreamPETR\u2019s original paper.This allowed us to fairly evaluate the speedup benefits and also demonstrate thegeneralization of our method targeting different hardware platforms.All of our trainings use 8 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs and conducted withPyTorch [51] V1.4.0. Our CPU is Intel Xeon E5-2698 and is used to solve theMINLP optimization(Eqn. 4).4.1 Classification Results on ImageNetIn Table 1, We report our pruning results and comparison with the baselinemethods on ResNet50 [25] and ImageNet [16]. We evaluate these results usingTop-1 Accuracy and Top-5 Accuracy to gauge the recovered accuracy after fine-tuning. In addition, we include inference FPS (im/s, i.e. images per second) todirectly showcase the speedups on the target hardware. We also present FLOPsfor completeness.Compared with previous methods like HALP [54] and SMCP [31], we achievea significantly improved accuracy-latency trade-off. For instance, SMCP reachesa Top-1 accuracy of 72.7 with an inference speed of 3784 im/s; our methodslightly surpasses its Top-1 with an accuracy of72.8 but with a considerablyfaster inference speed of 4210 im/s. With larger pruning, HALP achieves aTop-1 accuracy of68.6 with an inference speed of4101 im/s, our method signif-icantly outperforms it with a Top-1 accuracy of70.0 and an impressive FPS of5262 im/s. Notably, we can observe from Table 1 that our method particularlyexcels when targeting high FPS with substantial pruning from pre-trainedmodels, corroborating the effectiveness of improvements from our method. Ourimprovements could be observed more clearly in the FPS v.s.

Modern systems--- Page 13 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 13deploy convolutional layers for features extraction and transformer layers forcapturing global cues [15,65]. In this section, we explore our pruning effectivenessfor these hybrid models. We focus on the challenging task of 3D object detection,using the widely recognized Nuscenes [9] dataset and the state-of-the-art modelStreamPETR [60], composed of a heavy CNN-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. Our analysis of the system\u2019s latency revealed that the CNN-basedencoder has a higher latency (16.7ms) than the transformer decoder (14ms).This indicates that applying our method to the convolutional layers can stilleffectively accelerate the entire network.Detailed results and comparisons with several competitive baselines are pre-sentedinTable 2.Ourevaluationincorporatedadiversesetofmetricscommonlyadopted for 3D object detection tasks [9,42,60], including the mean Average Pre-cision (mAP) and Normalized Detection Score (NDS). Additionally, we reportthe FPS to highlight the improvements in speed.Significantly, when compared to the dense pre-trained StreamPETR model,our technique achieved a substantial acceleration of approximately18%, result-ing in an impressive37.3 FPS as opposed to the baseline\u2019s31.7 FPS. Impor-tantly,thisspeedboostwasachievedwithoutsacrificingperformance:ourprunedmodel attained superior mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) and NDS (0.551 vs. 0.546). Incomparison to the previous pruning method HALP [54], our approach exhibitedremarkable improvements in accuracy-latency trade-offs across various pruningratios. For instance, HALP managed to produce a pruned StreamPETR modelwith an mAP of0.373, an NDS of0.489, and an inference FPS of42.5. In con-trast, our approach surpassed these results, achieving an mAP of0.394, an NDSof 0.512, and an inference FPS of43.3.4.4 Ablation Study4.4.1 As discussed in detail in Sec. 3.1, our pruning method introduces twokey improvements from prior methods: (a)\u201cbilayer configuration latency" foraccurate latency modeling;(b)"block grouping" for integration of block removalwith channel sparsity.We\u2019ll now explore the individual impacts of(a) and (b) on pruning perfor-mance. Thebaseline here is thus a bare latency pruning algorithm without both(a) and (b). We then ablate each component by separately adding them on topof the baseline to check inidividual improvement. The baseline performance isdepicted in Fig. 4 with label \u201cBaseline".Bilayer Configuration LatencyIn this setting, we add our \u201cbilayer configura-tion latency" on top of the baseline but drop theblock groupingstep to excludethe block decision variables from the MINLP program 4. This variant accuratelyestimates the latency impacts of pruning by considering variations in both inputand output channel counts, but it cannot handle removal of entire blocks. Theresult, labeled \u201cOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)" in Fig. 4, show a markedly betteraccuracy-latency tradeoff than the baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness evenwhen used alone.--- Page 14 ---14 X.Sun et al.2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000FPS69707172737475T op1BaselineOurs(Only Bilayer Latency)Ours(Only Block Grouping)OursFig. 4: Ablation study results on Ima-geNet with ResNet50.

We show re-sults of ours and HALP [54] with differentpruning steps.Block GroupingIn this setting, we add our \u201cblock grouping" step to the base-line but do not use our \u201cbilayer configuration latency" to model latency impactsfrom pruning. Instead, we use previous methods\u2019 latency modeling [31,52,54],which only account for variations in output channel counts. This variant caneffectively handle the removal of block strucutres to accommodate high pruningratiosbutbutcannotaccuratelyestimatelatencyimpactsbyconsideringchangesin both input and output channel counts. The results, labeled \u201cOurs(Only BlockGrouping)" in Fig. 4, show an evidently improved accuracy-latency tradeoff com-pared to the baseline, particularly at large pruning ratios and latency reduc-tion(rightmost points in the curves). This indicates the effectiveness of "blockgrouping" even when used independently.4.4.2 By integrating our above two strategies into a unified MINLP frame-work, we enable efficient and single-pass pruning.Single-passv.s.IterativePruning Oursingle-passpruningapproachachievesthe target latency in just one step, while iterative methods like HALP [54] re-quire up to 30 steps. Performance comparisons between our method and HALPacross different pruning steps are shown in Table 3.As observed, our approach performs consistently well regardless of the prun-ing steps. Our single-pass performance is even better than our 30-steps iterativepruning. We believe this is likely due to the benefit of using importance scoresfrom all samples in the dataset at once.In contrast, HALP\u2019s performance worsens with fewer pruning steps, espe-cially in single-pass pruning where it defies the latency budget and over-prunes,leading to a Top-1 of65.1 and FPS of4444. This behavior is because the over-sights of (a) and (b) can be somewhat mitigated with multiple pruning steps,but become more pronounced with just one or fewer steps.5 ConclusionIn this paper, we introduce a novel pruning framework called MDP that inte-grates channel, layer, and block pruning within a unified optimization processand develop an accurate latency modeling technique that captures simultane-ous input and output channel variations. To incorporate these strategies, we--- Page 15 ---Multi-Dimensional Pruning 15reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to effi-ciently identify the optimal pruned structure within a specific latency budgetin a single pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over pre-vious methods, especially in scenarios requiring large pruning. We also pro-vide an in-depth ablation study to investigate each contribution individually.References1.

Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #22, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of DeepNetworks via Convex OptimizationPrateek Varshney Mert PilanciStanford University{vprateek,pilanci}@stanford.eduAbstractDeploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edgedevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and thecomplexities of non-convex optimization.

The performance of thesemodels typically scale with their size, width and architectural complexity, leading to the developmentof increasingly large models to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, this also necessitatessignificant computational, memory and energy resources to attain reasonable performance (Biancoet al., 2018; Rosenfeld, 2021); making their deployment impractical for resource-constrained edgedevices \u2013 such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and wearable technology \u2013 which are of daily use(Ignatov et al., 2019; Anwar and Raychowdhury, 2020; Seng et al., 2023; Chen and Liu, 2021). Edgedeep learning is crucial in these contexts to enable real-time processing, reduce latency, and ensurereliable operation without constant network connectivity (Kusupati et al., 2018; Tan and Le, 2019;V oghoei et al., 2018; Zaidi et al., 2022). Even in cases where such devices can make predictions byoffloading the the computations to large models on cloud servers, developing memory and computePreprint. Under review.arXiv:2410.06567v1  [cs.LG]  9 Oct 2024--- Page 2 ---efficient models is still advantageous as it reduces network bandwidth usage, lowers operational costs,and allows cloud services to serve more clients within the same resource constraints.Non-convex optimization, which forms the bedrock of training DNNs, poses significant theoreticaland practical challenges. Finding the global minimum can be NP-hard in the worst case and theoptimization landscape is riddled with local minima (Yao, 1992; Bartlett and Ben-David, 1999)and saddle points (Dauphin et al., 2014), making it difficult to guarantee convergence to a globaloptimum (Choromanska et al., 2015). Moreover, even training these models in a distributed manneron multiple GPUs can take days or weeks to complete. Convex optimization, on the other hand, iswell-studied with strong theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms (Boyd and Vandenberghe,2004). While there are recent works that show one can reformulate the optimization of certainclasses of non-convex NNs as convex problems (Pilanci and Ergen, 2020a; Ergen et al., 2022a),convex models are generally considered less expressive than their non-convex counterparts (Guss andSalakhutdinov, 2019; Scarselli and Chung Tsoi, 1998) and have been overshadowed by the successof deep learning in recent years.Although large non-convex DNNs possess immense expressive power, they often contain redundantweights that contribute little to the overall performance in downstream tasks (Frankle and Carbin,2019; Han et al., 2015). This phenomenon called Implicit Bias has been well established in boththeory and practice (Soudry et al., 2024; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Morwani et al., 2023; Shah et al.,2020). Additionally, while DNNs have the capacity to memorize the training dataset, they often endup learning basic solutions that generalize well to test datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). Both of theseobservations motivate using smaller, compressed models that eliminate unnecessary parameters whileachieving comparable performance. Common techniques for model compression include networkpruning (Han et al., 2015), low-rank approximation (Denil et al., 2013), and quantization (Gong et al.,2014). However, these methods often significantly degrade performance of the resulting model unlesssupplemented by another round of extensive fine-tuning on the labeled training data post-compression,which may not be feasible in many practical scenarios. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promisingalternative that enables a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model (Hinton et al.,2015) by training the student to mimic the outputs or intermediate representations of the teacher bymatching certain statistical metrics between the two models. While KD can significantly enhance theperformance of the student model, it often still requires fine-tuning the student model on labeled datain conjunction with the activation matching objective, limiting its applicability in situations wherelabeled data or compute is scarce or unavailable.In this paper, we bridge the gap between the non-convex and convex regimes by demonstrating thatconvex neural network architectures can achieve performance comparable to non-convex models fordownstream tasks when leveraging rich feature representations. To demonstrate this, we focus on themodel compression via KD framework and propose a novel approach that compresses non-convexDNNs via convex optimization. Our approach replaces the original complex non-convex layers inthe teacher module with simpler layers having convex gating functions in the student module. Bymatching the activation values between the teacher and student modules, we eliminate the needfor post-compression fine-tuning on labeled data, making our method suitable for deployment inenvironments where labeled data is scarce. Our method not only maintains the performance of theoriginal large model, but also capitalizes on the favorable optimization landscape of convex models.This enables users to employ a range of highly efficient and specialized convex solvers tailored totheir resource requirements, resulting in faster convergence and the potential for on-device learningusing online data\u2014a significant advantage for edge devices with limited computational resources.Summary of our Contributions:Efficient Convex-based Distillation and Deployment: We introduce a novel knowledge distillationapproach that leverages convex neural network architectures to compress DNNs. By replacing non-convex layers with convex gating functions in the student module, we exploit the well-understoodtheoretical foundations and efficient algorithms available in the convex optimization literature. Ourmethod achieves better performance than non-convex distillation approaches even when using thesame optimizer due to a more favorable optimization landscape. Moreover, the convexity of thestudent module allows us to employ faster and more specialized convex optimization algorithms,leading to accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead. This facilitates real-timeexecution and on-device learning on resource-constrained edge devices.2--- Page 3 ---Label-Free Compression Without Fine-Tuning: Our method focuses on activation matchingbetween a larger non-convex teacher module and a smaller convex student module on unlabeleddata. We show that for many real-world tasks, convex distillation in itself sufficient for the resultingmodel to perform well at inference time, eliminating the need for any fine-tuning on labeled data aftercompression. This makes our approach applicable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.Bridging the Non-Convex and Convex Regimes: To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork that marries the expressive representational power of non-convex DNNs with the theoreticaland computational advantages of convex architectures. Our empirical results on real-world datasetsdemonstrate that convex student models can achieve high compression rates without sacrificingaccuracy, often significantly outperforming non-convex compression methods in low-sample andhigh-compression regimes. This provides strong empirical evidence supporting the viability of convexneural networks when leveraging rich features from pre-trained non-convex teacher models, openingnew avenues for research at the intersection of deep learning and convex optimization.2 Other Related WorkKnowledge distillation (KD) has been a pivotal technique for compressing DNNs by transferringknowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this section, we discuss severalrelated methods, highlighting their advantages and the limitations that our approach addresses.In their seminal work, Romero et al. (2015) introduced FitNets, where a thin and wide studentmodel mimics the behavior of a larger teacher models by matching intermediate representations.By aligning the activations of a guided layer in the student with the outputs of the hint layer in theteacher, they prevent over-regularization and allow effective learning of the student on the trainingdataset. Since Fitnets were introduced, many methods have proposed modifications on top of them,such as designing new types of features (Kim et al., 2020; Srinivas and Fleuret, 2018), changingthe teacher/student architectures (Lee et al., 2022) and distilling across multiple layers (Chen et al.,2021). However, nearly all of them require access to labeled training data for fine-tuning, and theoptimization process remains non-convex, making convergence guarantees difficult.Tung and Mori (2019) proposed a method inspired by contrastive learning: preserve the relativerepresentational structure of the data in the student model by ensuring that input pairs that producesimilar (or dissimilar) activations in the teacher model produce similar (or dissimilar) activationsin the student network. This approach improves generalization but is computationally expensive,especially with large batch, due to the quadratic complexity of producing pairwise comparisons.Further, training objective is a weighted sum of cross entropy loss between the pairwise similarityactivations and a fine-tuning loss on the training data, necessitating access to labeled training data.Heo et al. (2018) introduced an activation transfer loss that minimizes the differences in booleanactivation patterns instead. This addresses the issue of the \u21132 loss emphasizing samples with largeactivation differences while underweighting those with small yet significant differences, which canmake it difficult to differentiate between weak and zero responses. However, their method involvesoptimizing a computationally intensive non-convex objective function.Recent advances have explored KD without access to the original training data. Yin et al. Raikwarand Mishra (2022) proposed generating synthetic data by sampling from a Gaussian distribution andadjusting the distributions within the teacher model\u2019s hidden layers. While this allows for label-freedistillation, the synthetic data may not capture the complexity of real data distributions. Additionally,their method relies on specific implementations of BatchNorm layers in the teacher model and focuseson label-free distillation without addressing the challenges of non-convex optimization. Since ourmethod is only concerned with intermediate activations and not the input-output nature of samples, itis also directly applicable on the synthetic data generated by their approach.3 Preliminaries3.1 Notation[m] denotes the set {1, 2, . . . , m}. For a matrix A, Ai denotes ith row of A. For a vector x, xidenotes ith element of x. We sometimes use xj to denote an indexed vector; in this case xj,i denotesthe ith element of xj. \u2225 \xb7 \u22252 denotes euclidean norm of a vector. For a sparse vector v \u2208 Rd, wedefine the support as supp(v) ={i \u2208 [d]|vi \u0338= 0}. We use I to denote the identity matrix and 1 (\xb7)3--- Page 4 ---to be the indicator function. For a matrix V \u2208 Rd\xd7r, vec(V) \u2208 Rdr vectorizes the matrix V bystacking columns sequentially. Unless stated otherwise, n is the number of samples in the trainingdataset and d is the dimenionality of the input samples.3.2 Convex Neural NetworksPilanci and Ergen (2020b) prove that training a two-layer fully-connected NNs with ReLU activationscan be reformulated as standard convex optimization problems. This result is important because itallows us to leverage convex optimization techniques while retaining the expressive power of DNNs.Theorem 1 (Convex equivalence for ReLU networks). Let X \u2208 Rn\xd7d be a data matrix and y \u2208 Rnthe associated scalar targets. The two-layer ReLU neural network can then be expressed as:hReLUW1,w2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)w2i,where W1 \u2208 Rm\xd7d, w2 \u2208 Rm are the weights of the first and second layers, m is the numberof hidden units, and ReLU(\xb7) is the ReLU activation. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 thatminimize the convex loss function Lconvex with a \u03bb-\u21132 regularization penalty can be obtained by firstsolving the following optimization problem:minv,uLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vi \u2212 ui), y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vi\u22252 + \u2225ui\u22252), s.t. vi, ui \u2208 Ki, (1)where sub-sampling is over neurons i \u2208 [m], DX = {D = diag(1 (Xu \u2265 0)) :u \u2208 Rd} is the set ofhyperplane arrangement patterns i.e. the set of activation patterns of neuron i in the hidden layer fora fixed X and Ki = {u \u2208 Rd : (2Di \u2212 I)Xu \u227d 0} is a convex cone; and setting{W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190SDi\u2208D\u2032 {(v\u22c6i , 1) :v\u22c6i \u0338= 0)} \u222a {(u\u22c6i , \u22121) :u\u22c6i \u0338= 0)}, \u2200k \u2208 [m], k > m\u22c6,(0, 0), otherwisefor some m\u22c6 s.t. m > m\u22c6 and m\u22c6 \u2264 n + 1.This leads to solving a practically intractable quadratic program for large d as |DX| \u2208 O(r(nr )r)where r = rank(X) \u2264 d < n. Instead, we solve an unconstrained version of the above problem:Theorem 2 (Convex equivalence for GReLU networks). Let G \u2282Rd and \u03d5g(X, u) =diag(1 (Xg \u22650))Xu denote the gated ReLU (GReLU) activation function. Then the modelhGReLUW1,w2 (X) =Xg\u2208G\u03d5g(XW1i)w2iis a GReLU network where each g is a fixed gate. Let gi \u2208 Rd such that diag(Xgi \u2265 0) = Diand G\u2032 = {gi : Di \u2208 DX}. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 for the regularized convex lossfunction can be obtained by solving the following convex optimization problem:minvLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiXvi, y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX\u2225vi\u22252, (2)and setting {W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190nvi\u22c6\u221a\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225,p\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225o\u2200i.The main difference between Theorem 2 and Theorem 1 is the activation function. Using fixedgates g, the activation function \u03d5g(X, W1i) is linear in W1i and the non-linearity introduced by thegating matrix is fixed with respect to the optimization variables W1 and w2. Since each term in theoptimization problem involves a product of \u03d5gi(XW1i) and w2i, it is bilinear in W1i and w2i. Atfirst glance, this may suggest that the optimization is non-convex as bilinear functions are generallynon-convex. However, in this specific case, we can transform the problem into a convex one throughreparameterization (specifically, set vi = W1iw2i). (For details, see Section A.1)One can show that the solutions to the optimization problems in Theorems 2 and 1 are guaranteedto approximate each other if the number of samples is sufficiently large. Kim and Pilanci (2024)show that under certain assumptions on the input data On/d \xb7 log nGaussian gates are sufficient4--- Page 5 ---for local gradient methods to converge with high probability to a stationary point that is O(\u221alog n)relative approximation of the global optimum of the non-convex problem. Lastly, note that the abovetheorems are hold only for scalar outputs, and by extension, binary classification problems. Mishkinet al. (2022) extend the above theorems to vector valued outputs by using a one-vs-all approach foreach entry in the output vector and the following reformulation:Theorem 3 (Convex equivalence for vector output networks). Let C be the model output dimension,Y \u2208 Rn\xd7C the associated targets, and W2 \u2208 RC\xd7m the weights of the second layer. Then,A. The two-layer ReLU neural network with vector output can be expressed as:hReLUW1,W2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)WT2i,and the optimal weights W\u22c61 and W\u22c62 can recovered by solving the following one-vs-all convexoptimization problem:min{vk,uk}Ck=1Lconvex CXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vik \u2212 uik)eTk , Y+ \u03bbCXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vik\u22252 + \u2225uik\u22252),(3)s.t. (2Di \u2212 In)Xvik \u227d 0, (2Di \u2212 In)Xuik \u227d 0. (4)B. The two-layer GReLU neural network with vector output and the corresponding convex optimiza-tion problem can be expressed similarly to the above except with the change thatPmi=1 ReLU(XW1i)is replaced by Pg\u2208G \u03d5g(XW1,i) in the statements and the constrained nuclear norm penalty beingreplaced with a standard nuclear norm penalty.Further, works by Gupta et al. (2021); Sahiner et al. (2021; 2022a;b) have extended this convexreformulation to modules prevalent in deep neural networks such as convolution layers, batchnormalization, self-attention transformers etc.4 Approach: Distillation via Activation Matching4.1 Distilling Vision Classification Models using Convex Networks.478.376 .169.263.674.456 .134 .223.122.326channel012r ow0 1 2.255 .231 .342.124.232.123.194 .202 .275 column012Input: xOutput: ymodel.Block1CNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL Umodel.Block2 model.Block3z xf S (z x )f T (z x )model.Block4T eacher (T)Student (S)model.f cF r o z en model la y ersDistilled la y ersoutput activ ationinput activ ationz xinput activ ationReL U+xReL UBatch norm3 x 3 Conv3 x 3 ConvBatch normFigure 1: For Resnet18 architecture, we first distill Block4 by training our convex block (orange) over input-output activations dataset. Post-training, we simply swap out the exisiting non-convex block and replace it withour convex block. Note that all other layers are kept frozen (marked in purple).Consider a Model M that has been trained on a dataset DTrain := {xTraini , yTraini }Ni=1 drawn from thedata distribution D. As discussed previously, one common way to compress the model size is toprune the architecture, say via magnitude thresholding, and get rid of redundant or non-contributingweights across the DNN layers. In our case, we will focus on compressing the upper blocks of themodel where each block itself can comprise of multiple layers of varying kinds such as Convolution,Batchnorm, Pooling, MLP, etc. We refer to the (original) block that we want to compress as Teacher(T ) and the post-distillation resulting block to be Student (S). We use these terms to conceptuallyrelate to the nomenclature prevalent in distillation literature.5--- Page 6 ---Let the set of input activations just before the Teacher block T generated by inferencing the M witha single pass over a dataset D \u223c Dbe {zx}. Let the output functions of T and S blocks be denotedby fT (\xb7) and fS(\xb7) respectively. Then we can distill the knowledge of T onto S by minimizing thefollowing activation matching objective:Ldistil = Ex,y\u223cDh\u2225fT (zx) \u2212 fS(zx)\u222522i, (5)i.e., we enforce the new block S to learn the input-output activation value mapping over the datadistribution. In practice however, we find the optimal weights of S by solving the following ERM:Ldistil(DTrain) =Xxi,yi\u2208DTrain\u2225fT (zxi) \u2212 fS(zxi)\u222522. (6)Once we have trained S with activation matching, we simply swap out T with S. Post replacement,we do not perform any fine-tuning of any other parameter of the model using the training dataset. Infact, all other layers in the model are kept frozen with their original weights and we directly performtest time inference (see Figure 4.1). Note how this approach is label free as there is no explicitdependency on the output y in the optimization problem. The only design constraint for S is that thedimensions of input-output of S should exactly match the dimensions for the input-output activationsof the original block T , i.e., dim(fS(\xb7)) =dim(fT (\xb7)).Unlike other distillation methods that preserve non-convexity our approach gets rid of any non-convexity in the constituent layers of S. For instance, consider Figure 4.1 where the number ofparameters in T increase significantly as we move from Block #1 to Block #4 ((see Table 4.1). Block#4 of Resnet18 alone contributes roughly 70% of the total model size and compressing it to \u2248 1/8-thits size compresses the overall model by60%. Each block in Resnet18 has multiple CNN, Batchnorm,AvgPool, and ReLU layers which results in sophisticated non-convex model with high expressivity.Table 1: Comparison of number of parameters in the 4 Blocks of Renset18 model. d and C denote the inputand output activation dimensions for each Block. The last two columns denote to what degree distilling a blocks(S) to a fixed parameter count compresses that particular block as well as the overall model.RESNET BLOCK INPUT DIM (d) OUTPUT DIM (C) #PARAMS(T) #PARAMS(S) SPARSITYBLOCK OVERALLBLOCK1 64\xd78 \xd78 64\xd78 \xd78 147,968 73,328 0.495 0.994BLOCK2 64\xd78 \xd78 128\xd74 \xd74 525,568 164,608 0.313 0.969BLOCK3 128\xd74 \xd74 256\xd72 \xd72 2,099,712 656,896 0.313 0.8765BLOCK4 256\xd72 \xd72 512\xd71 \xd71 8,393,728 1,312,768 0.156 0.394.We now describe how to construct a convexS. Note that AvgPool is a linear operator and thereforepreserves convexity. Furthermore, training regularized ReLU networks with Batchnorm can bereformulated as a finite-dimensional convex problem (Ergen et al., 2022b). Therefore, a compositionof these operations is still a convex operation. Now, the non-convexity ofT stems primarily from thecomposition of multiple ReLU layers inside the block. Consider the simplified functional expressionof the teacher module where we omit all the Batchnorm and AvgPool layers, fT (zx) = t\u25e6k(zx),wheret(z) =CNN2ReLU(CNN1(z)), (7)i.e., T is the composition of k smaller 2-CNN layer ReLU networks (t(\xb7)) and k is a fixed numberthat depends on actual the model architecture.To distill this via convex models, we will setS to be a 3-CNN layer block such that:fS(zx) =CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 1 (CNN1(zx) > 0). (8)Remarks on the convexity ofS: In Sahiner et al., it is shown that the above architecture corresponds tothe Burer-Monteiro factorization of the convex NN objective in equation 4 for vector outputs, and alllocal minima are globally optimal (see Theorem 3.3 in Sahiner et al.). Also note (i) 1 (CNN1(z) > 0)is a boolean mask that masks out the corresponding entries in the outputs ofCNN2(z). Since the maskvalues are {0, 1}, no gradient is back-propagated to the parameters of CNN1, it does not contributeany effective parameter to the model size. Alternatively, we can mask out CNN2(z) using fixedboolean masks. (ii) CNN2(z) is the main output generating layer. iii) CNN1\xd713 is 1 \xd7 1 filter whichis used to ensure that the shapes of fT (zx) and sT (zx) match. Observe that it was not necessaryfor S in this example to be composed of CNN layers. In fact, any block that matches input-outputactivation dimensions, irrespective of the architecture design, could have been used.6--- Page 7 ---4.2 Accelerating Distillation using Convex SolversIn the previous subsection, we discussed how one can compress a large model by distilling its largenon-convex modules into smaller convex modules. When the optimization problem is convex, saddlepoints and non- global minima do not exist, facilitating faster convergence even with momentum-basedoptimization methods (Assran and Rabbat, 2020). Therefore, convex formulations can acceleratethe test-time fine-tuning of the compressed model in presence of new data when compared to theirnon-convex counterparts. To push these benefits to the limit, we employ fast convex solvers.Given that the only constraint on S is matching the shape of the input-output activations with T , wedraw inspiration from the work of Mishkin et al. (2022) on 2-layer convex and non-convex MLPmodels, and setup S as a 2-layer GReLU MLP along the lines of Theorems 2 and 3. While wedemonstrate the effects of convexity when using standard optimtizers like Adam (Paszke et al., 2019)to train S, solving the resulting group lasso regression can be more efficiently handled by specializedconvex optimization algorithms. The SCNN Python library 1 provides fast and reliable algorithms forconvex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Specifically, itimplements the R-FISTA algorithm, an improved version of the FISTA algorithm (Beck and Teboulle,2009), which combines line search, careful step-size initialization, and data normalization to enhanceconvergence. We utilized R-FISTA as the convex solver in this paper.4.3 Improving Convex Solvers Via PolishingW 1 1 W 2 1 W 2 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 2 Figure 2: To improve SCNN\u2019s one-vs-all solution, we freezeW\u22c61 but recompute W\u22c62 for equation 6 by enforcing informa-tion sharing (red lines) across the constituent W1i\u2019s.While the SCNN package is optimized forscalar outputs, it handles vector output op-timization problems by adopting a one-vs-all approach for each output dimension, i.e.return WT2 \u2190 [w21, w22, . . . ,w2C]m\xd7Cwhere each w2i \u2208 Rm. This inhibits anyinformation sharing between the weightmatrices corresponding to different nodesin the multi-dimensional model output. Toovercome this, we can explicitly impose in-formation sharing between the weight ma-trices w2js, and in the process arguablyobtain a better solution for W2 an evensparse solution for W1, leading to possi-bility of further model compression. Oneway to do this is to freeze the stacked W1matrices computed by SCNN and recompute W\u22c62 (initialized with W2 obtained from SCNN) butwith a group elastic constraint on rows of W2 (See Appendix A.2 for the mathematical setup). Usinga group elastic constraint on the "shared" W2 regressor encourages using features from differentW1\u2019s and therefore acts as a feature selector. This essentially translates to zeroing-out entire columnsof W1 and compress the model further. To implement this, we use the open source python packageAdelie2 that can solve the group elastic regression problem in a heavily parallelized manner.5 ExperimentsIn this section, we conduct an empirical study with the following goals: a) to demonstrate that usingconvex neural networks and distilling via convex optimization performs as well, if not better than,non-convex distillation; and b) to show that our approach generalizes well in low-sample regimeand that using convex solvers is an order of magnitude faster than training non-convex models. Weconsider the following baselines: 1) Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT) : The original full fine-tunedmodel (T ) undergoing compression, 2) Convex-Gated (Sconvex): learns a compressed block withconvex-gating activations, 3)Non-Convex (Snon-convex) learns a non-convex compressed block withReLU activation, and 4) Pruning (Sprune): prunes the weights in T . We set the compressed blocksSnon-convex and Sprune s.t. they have the same parameter count as in Sconvex. This enables a fairperformance comparison between each of the distillation methods. We use SVHN (Netzer et al.,2011), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009), TinyImagenet (Le and Yang, 2015), and VisualWake Words (Chowdhery et al., 2019) datasets to establish the validity of our approach.1https://pypi.org/project/pyscnn/2https://jamesyang007.github.io/adelie/index.html7--- Page 8 ---5.1 Convex Distillation of CNN Blocks using standard optimizersFirst, we measure the performance of KD based compressed blocks, as described in Section 4.1, bycomparing the effects of convexity and non-convexity in the design ofS:Snon-convex = CNN2ReLU(CNN1(zx)), Sconvex = CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 (CNN1(zx) > 0),and optimizing the Mean Squared Error as Lconvex in equation 6 using Adam Optimizer. For bothmethods, we incorporate BatchNorm and AvgPool layers in the architecture since they preserveconvexity and lead to improved results. To obtain different compression rates when distilling theblocks (reported as X times the original model size), we vary the number of filters of CNN2 in Sconvexfrom 1 to 512 in multiples of 2. Then, for a fair comparison, we adjust the number of filters inthe CNN layers of Snon-convex to match the parameter count of Sconvex. Since CNN1 provides only aboolean mask and has no gradient back-propagated to it, and CNN3 is a 1 \xd7 1 convolution layer,typically for the same number of filters, #\u03b8non-convex \u2248 2 \xd7 #\u03b8convex.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Renset18 on SVHN: 10-Way ClassificationOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation (Snon convex)(a) Test Accuracies on the SVHN dataset when com-pressing only the fourth CNN block.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Resent18 CIFAR10 with 100 Train Samples/ClassOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)(b) Full Test Set Accuracies when given only 100training samples per class in CIFAR10,Figure 3: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex performance comparisons in low-sample and high compression regimes.Figure 3a demonstrates the test-set accuracy versus total model size as we double the number offilters in the compressed Block 4 of ResNet-18 on the SVHN dataset. Note that in the extremelylow model size regime (number of filters = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), Sconvex significantly outperforms Snon-convex.On the CIFAR10 dataset, we also compress Block 3 along with Block 4 of Resnet18 by varying thenumber of filters in multiples of 2 from 1 to 512. We compare the performance of both Sconvex andSnon-convex against magnitude-based pruning, where we preserve a certain percentage of weights basedon their magnitude and zero out the remaining entries in the weight matrices.

All subplotscompare the test set accuracies without any post-compression training or fine-tuning on the labeleddataset. Note that utilizing the compressed versions for both Blocks 3 and 4 leads to \u223c10x compres-sion compared to the original fine-tuned model in size, with no significant drop in performance on the8--- Page 9 ---full test set. The figure shows that while both Sconvex and Snon-convex perform well when distilling onlyBlock 3, Sconvex outperforms Snon-convex when distilling Block 4, especially at higher compressionrates. This becomes more evident as we use different compressed combinations of both Blocks 3 & 4.Next, we consider the performance of Sconvex and Snon-convex in the low-sample regime. We train bothSconvex and Snon-convex (compressing Block 4) using only 100 randomly selected training samples perclass and compare their performance on the full dataset (\u223c 25K samples) against the Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on original training dataset. Figure 3b shows that performance gap between Sconvex andSnon-convex is even more prominent in this data-scarce regime.So far, we have used the Adam optimizer to train both the convex and non-convex compressed blocksin these experiments. In the subsequent experiments, we leverage fast convex solvers for distillation.5.2 Fast Distillation Using Convex Solvers10 2 10 1 100Time (seconds)0.500.550.600.650.700.750.80T est AccuracyDifferent Optimization Routines distilling Resnet18 for TinyImagenetOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Augmented Lagrangian (AL) for (Sconvex)RFISTA (Sconvex)Approx.

We use the SCNN library to solve theactivation-matching problem for Sconvex and theAdam optimizer for the Snon-convex block. Thetime budget for Adam is set slightly higher thanthat used by SCNN for a fair comparison. Recallthat having a convex optimization problem forSconvex gives us the liberty to choose any convexsolver, which requires minimal hand-tuning ofhyperparameters.

In thisDataset, we have 500 training and 100 test samples per class, representing a data-scarce regime. Fordistilling to Snon-convex, we use both full-batch and mini-batch training using Adam. The experimentis repeated over 10 different seeds, and we plot the error curves for each method, with the solidline representing the mean and the shaded region indicating twice the standard deviation. The plotshows that RFISTA and Approximate Cone Decomposition are superior among the convex solvers.In contrast, both versions of Adam-trained non-convex models take nearly one-two orders of moretime to reach the performance achieved by the convex solvers.0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05Time (seconds)2030405060708090T est Accuracy2.1M2.0M 1.9M 1.8M 1.6M 1.4M1.2M 1.0MOnly 1 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.5M1.8M 1.8M 1.7M 1.7M 1.6M 1.5M 1.3M 1.2M 1.1M 0.9MOnly 10 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.3M1.3M1.3M 1.3M 1.2M 1.2M 1.2MOnly 25 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)Regularization Path Acc for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 6: As we vary the number of training samples per class, we see that in extremely resource-constrainedsettings convex distillation does much better than non-convex distillation on the test set.Since SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem for vector outputs, for the 10-way classification problemof CIFAR10, we set the hidden dimension of the network to be 25, determine the total number ofnon-zero entries in the weight matrices computed by SCNN (using the RFISTA solver) and use thatto set the hidden layer size of the non-convex block. For an elaborate comparison between the twomethods, at each point of the regularization path computed by SCNN, we track the the time requiredby it to solve the activation matching problem and use that as a time budget for the Adam-basedSnon-convex training. We also impose constraints on the available number of training samples and report9--- Page 10 ---the test set accuracy of each method after swapping the distilled blocks back into the original model.Figure 6 shows the experiment results when we try to distill Block 4 from it\u2019s original 8M parametercount to \u223c1M at different training samples/class configurations. Note how in extreme labeled trainingdata scarce settings, convex distillation performs far better than non-convex distillation.5.3 Distillation via Proximal Gradient Methods followed by polishingOne may notice in Figure 6 that as we relax the constraints on the training time and the number oftraining samples available per class, non-convex NN seems to catch up to convex NN distillation.20 40 60 80 100#TrainSamples/Class76788082848688Complete T est Set AccuracyConvex AccNon-Convex AccFFT Accuracy @ #params = 8393728SCNN+Adelie+Polish for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 7: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex Test Accuracies when givenonly 100 training samples per class for activation matchingOne key reason is that SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem which inhibits any infor-mation sharing between the weight matri-ces corresponding to different nodes in themulti-dimensional model output. To over-come this, we recompute W\u22c62 by explic-itly imposing information sharing betweenthe constituent weight matrices (See Sec-tion 4.3). By obtaining a shared W2, werecover any performance lost due to ad-ditional compression by polishing and re-solving a regularized linear regression prob-lem. Figure 7 shows that even for relaxedresource constraints, convex optimizationbased distillation performs at least as good as with Adam-based non-convex block distillation. We be-lieve that here convex distillation approach would outperform non-convex distillation ifS comprisedof CNN layers instead of linear layers. Since SCNN only solves the training of 2-layer MLPs, we areconstrained by the types of experiments we can do.5.4 Beyond Distillation: End-To-End Fine-tuning of Convex ArchitecturesTable 2: Convex vs. Non-Convex: Visual Wake WordsBack-Bone Classification Head AccuracyFrozen Convex 81.36Frozen Non-Convex 80.84Trainable Convex 83.47Trainable Non-Convex 83.42As an ablation experiment, we study how con-vexity affects the fine-tuning of DNNs on la-beled training datasets. Visual Wake Words isa benchmark dataset derived from COCO Linet al. (2015) that assesses the performance oftiny vision models at the microcontroller scale(memory footprint of less than 250KB). For ourexperiment, we consider the Person/Not Persontask, where the vision model determines whethera person is present in the image. There are a total of \u223c115K images in the training and validationdataset \u223c 8k images in the test dataset. This task serves various edge machine learning use cases,such as in smart homes and retail stores, where we wish to detect the presence of specific objects ofinterest without a high inference cost. Using the ImageNet pre-trained MobileNet V3 model (Howardet al., 2019) as our base model, we preserve its back-bone upto the fourth layer and replace all thesubsequent layers with a smaller architecture as the classification head. The classification head canbe either convex or non-convex, as described in the previous experiments. We also consider scenarioswhere the back-bone is either kept frozen or trainable. We then fine-tune the resulting model on theCOCO dataset with Adam on Cross-Entropy Loss, and report the Test Accuracy in Table 2.When the back-bone is frozen, convex classification head performs noticeably better than its non-convex counterpart. This scenario represents a realistic situation where end-to-end fine-tuning of largemodels (e.g., large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs)) can be prohibitivelyexpensive for downstream tasks due to computational constraints. When the back-bone is trainable,i.e. all the parameters of the combined model can be updated during fine-tuning, using a convex headis very slightly better or nearly the same as a non-convex head. This experiment shows promise thatconvex NN architectures are good candidates for DNN applications beyond just distillation.6 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have introduced a novel approach that bridges the non-convex and convex regimesby combining the representational power of large non-convex DNNs with the favorable optimizationlandscape of convex NNs. Our experiments show that the disillation via convex architectures performs10--- Page 11 ---at least as good as prevalent non-convex distillation methods. Furthermore, our approach successfullydistill models in a completely label-free setting without requiring any post-compression fine-tuningon the training data. This work opens new avenues for deploying efficient, low-footprint modelson resource-constrained edge devices with on-device learning using online data. Future work couldfocus on developing convex optimization methods to directly solve for optimal weights withoutresorting to a one-vs-all setting for multi-dimensional outputs. Additionally, exploring applicationsin other domains, such as natural language processing and generative models, could further validateand expand the applicability of our approach.ReferencesWaseem Rawat and Zenghui Wang.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance. We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers. On Pixel 4's Edge TPU, these models improve the\naccuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA mobile models.\nPublication Date: 2020-03-05\narXiv paper ID: 2003.02838v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA.

Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions.

This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: Deeper and wider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior\nperformance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches.

This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #22, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of DeepNetworks via Convex OptimizationPrateek Varshney Mert PilanciStanford University{vprateek,pilanci}@stanford.eduAbstractDeploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edgedevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and thecomplexities of non-convex optimization.

The performance of thesemodels typically scale with their size, width and architectural complexity, leading to the developmentof increasingly large models to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, this also necessitatessignificant computational, memory and energy resources to attain reasonable performance (Biancoet al., 2018; Rosenfeld, 2021); making their deployment impractical for resource-constrained edgedevices \u2013 such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and wearable technology \u2013 which are of daily use(Ignatov et al., 2019; Anwar and Raychowdhury, 2020; Seng et al., 2023; Chen and Liu, 2021). Edgedeep learning is crucial in these contexts to enable real-time processing, reduce latency, and ensurereliable operation without constant network connectivity (Kusupati et al., 2018; Tan and Le, 2019;V oghoei et al., 2018; Zaidi et al., 2022). Even in cases where such devices can make predictions byoffloading the the computations to large models on cloud servers, developing memory and computePreprint. Under review.arXiv:2410.06567v1  [cs.LG]  9 Oct 2024--- Page 2 ---efficient models is still advantageous as it reduces network bandwidth usage, lowers operational costs,and allows cloud services to serve more clients within the same resource constraints.Non-convex optimization, which forms the bedrock of training DNNs, poses significant theoreticaland practical challenges. Finding the global minimum can be NP-hard in the worst case and theoptimization landscape is riddled with local minima (Yao, 1992; Bartlett and Ben-David, 1999)and saddle points (Dauphin et al., 2014), making it difficult to guarantee convergence to a globaloptimum (Choromanska et al., 2015). Moreover, even training these models in a distributed manneron multiple GPUs can take days or weeks to complete. Convex optimization, on the other hand, iswell-studied with strong theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms (Boyd and Vandenberghe,2004). While there are recent works that show one can reformulate the optimization of certainclasses of non-convex NNs as convex problems (Pilanci and Ergen, 2020a; Ergen et al., 2022a),convex models are generally considered less expressive than their non-convex counterparts (Guss andSalakhutdinov, 2019; Scarselli and Chung Tsoi, 1998) and have been overshadowed by the successof deep learning in recent years.Although large non-convex DNNs possess immense expressive power, they often contain redundantweights that contribute little to the overall performance in downstream tasks (Frankle and Carbin,2019; Han et al., 2015). This phenomenon called Implicit Bias has been well established in boththeory and practice (Soudry et al., 2024; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Morwani et al., 2023; Shah et al.,2020). Additionally, while DNNs have the capacity to memorize the training dataset, they often endup learning basic solutions that generalize well to test datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). Both of theseobservations motivate using smaller, compressed models that eliminate unnecessary parameters whileachieving comparable performance. Common techniques for model compression include networkpruning (Han et al., 2015), low-rank approximation (Denil et al., 2013), and quantization (Gong et al.,2014). However, these methods often significantly degrade performance of the resulting model unlesssupplemented by another round of extensive fine-tuning on the labeled training data post-compression,which may not be feasible in many practical scenarios. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promisingalternative that enables a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model (Hinton et al.,2015) by training the student to mimic the outputs or intermediate representations of the teacher bymatching certain statistical metrics between the two models. While KD can significantly enhance theperformance of the student model, it often still requires fine-tuning the student model on labeled datain conjunction with the activation matching objective, limiting its applicability in situations wherelabeled data or compute is scarce or unavailable.In this paper, we bridge the gap between the non-convex and convex regimes by demonstrating thatconvex neural network architectures can achieve performance comparable to non-convex models fordownstream tasks when leveraging rich feature representations. To demonstrate this, we focus on themodel compression via KD framework and propose a novel approach that compresses non-convexDNNs via convex optimization. Our approach replaces the original complex non-convex layers inthe teacher module with simpler layers having convex gating functions in the student module. Bymatching the activation values between the teacher and student modules, we eliminate the needfor post-compression fine-tuning on labeled data, making our method suitable for deployment inenvironments where labeled data is scarce. Our method not only maintains the performance of theoriginal large model, but also capitalizes on the favorable optimization landscape of convex models.This enables users to employ a range of highly efficient and specialized convex solvers tailored totheir resource requirements, resulting in faster convergence and the potential for on-device learningusing online data\u2014a significant advantage for edge devices with limited computational resources.Summary of our Contributions:Efficient Convex-based Distillation and Deployment: We introduce a novel knowledge distillationapproach that leverages convex neural network architectures to compress DNNs. By replacing non-convex layers with convex gating functions in the student module, we exploit the well-understoodtheoretical foundations and efficient algorithms available in the convex optimization literature. Ourmethod achieves better performance than non-convex distillation approaches even when using thesame optimizer due to a more favorable optimization landscape. Moreover, the convexity of thestudent module allows us to employ faster and more specialized convex optimization algorithms,leading to accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead. This facilitates real-timeexecution and on-device learning on resource-constrained edge devices.2--- Page 3 ---Label-Free Compression Without Fine-Tuning: Our method focuses on activation matchingbetween a larger non-convex teacher module and a smaller convex student module on unlabeleddata. We show that for many real-world tasks, convex distillation in itself sufficient for the resultingmodel to perform well at inference time, eliminating the need for any fine-tuning on labeled data aftercompression. This makes our approach applicable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.Bridging the Non-Convex and Convex Regimes: To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork that marries the expressive representational power of non-convex DNNs with the theoreticaland computational advantages of convex architectures. Our empirical results on real-world datasetsdemonstrate that convex student models can achieve high compression rates without sacrificingaccuracy, often significantly outperforming non-convex compression methods in low-sample andhigh-compression regimes. This provides strong empirical evidence supporting the viability of convexneural networks when leveraging rich features from pre-trained non-convex teacher models, openingnew avenues for research at the intersection of deep learning and convex optimization.2 Other Related WorkKnowledge distillation (KD) has been a pivotal technique for compressing DNNs by transferringknowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this section, we discuss severalrelated methods, highlighting their advantages and the limitations that our approach addresses.In their seminal work, Romero et al. (2015) introduced FitNets, where a thin and wide studentmodel mimics the behavior of a larger teacher models by matching intermediate representations.By aligning the activations of a guided layer in the student with the outputs of the hint layer in theteacher, they prevent over-regularization and allow effective learning of the student on the trainingdataset. Since Fitnets were introduced, many methods have proposed modifications on top of them,such as designing new types of features (Kim et al., 2020; Srinivas and Fleuret, 2018), changingthe teacher/student architectures (Lee et al., 2022) and distilling across multiple layers (Chen et al.,2021). However, nearly all of them require access to labeled training data for fine-tuning, and theoptimization process remains non-convex, making convergence guarantees difficult.Tung and Mori (2019) proposed a method inspired by contrastive learning: preserve the relativerepresentational structure of the data in the student model by ensuring that input pairs that producesimilar (or dissimilar) activations in the teacher model produce similar (or dissimilar) activationsin the student network. This approach improves generalization but is computationally expensive,especially with large batch, due to the quadratic complexity of producing pairwise comparisons.Further, training objective is a weighted sum of cross entropy loss between the pairwise similarityactivations and a fine-tuning loss on the training data, necessitating access to labeled training data.Heo et al. (2018) introduced an activation transfer loss that minimizes the differences in booleanactivation patterns instead. This addresses the issue of the \u21132 loss emphasizing samples with largeactivation differences while underweighting those with small yet significant differences, which canmake it difficult to differentiate between weak and zero responses. However, their method involvesoptimizing a computationally intensive non-convex objective function.Recent advances have explored KD without access to the original training data. Yin et al. Raikwarand Mishra (2022) proposed generating synthetic data by sampling from a Gaussian distribution andadjusting the distributions within the teacher model\u2019s hidden layers. While this allows for label-freedistillation, the synthetic data may not capture the complexity of real data distributions. Additionally,their method relies on specific implementations of BatchNorm layers in the teacher model and focuseson label-free distillation without addressing the challenges of non-convex optimization. Since ourmethod is only concerned with intermediate activations and not the input-output nature of samples, itis also directly applicable on the synthetic data generated by their approach.3 Preliminaries3.1 Notation[m] denotes the set {1, 2, . . . , m}. For a matrix A, Ai denotes ith row of A. For a vector x, xidenotes ith element of x. We sometimes use xj to denote an indexed vector; in this case xj,i denotesthe ith element of xj. \u2225 \xb7 \u22252 denotes euclidean norm of a vector. For a sparse vector v \u2208 Rd, wedefine the support as supp(v) ={i \u2208 [d]|vi \u0338= 0}. We use I to denote the identity matrix and 1 (\xb7)3--- Page 4 ---to be the indicator function. For a matrix V \u2208 Rd\xd7r, vec(V) \u2208 Rdr vectorizes the matrix V bystacking columns sequentially. Unless stated otherwise, n is the number of samples in the trainingdataset and d is the dimenionality of the input samples.3.2 Convex Neural NetworksPilanci and Ergen (2020b) prove that training a two-layer fully-connected NNs with ReLU activationscan be reformulated as standard convex optimization problems. This result is important because itallows us to leverage convex optimization techniques while retaining the expressive power of DNNs.Theorem 1 (Convex equivalence for ReLU networks). Let X \u2208 Rn\xd7d be a data matrix and y \u2208 Rnthe associated scalar targets. The two-layer ReLU neural network can then be expressed as:hReLUW1,w2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)w2i,where W1 \u2208 Rm\xd7d, w2 \u2208 Rm are the weights of the first and second layers, m is the numberof hidden units, and ReLU(\xb7) is the ReLU activation. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 thatminimize the convex loss function Lconvex with a \u03bb-\u21132 regularization penalty can be obtained by firstsolving the following optimization problem:minv,uLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vi \u2212 ui), y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vi\u22252 + \u2225ui\u22252), s.t. vi, ui \u2208 Ki, (1)where sub-sampling is over neurons i \u2208 [m], DX = {D = diag(1 (Xu \u2265 0)) :u \u2208 Rd} is the set ofhyperplane arrangement patterns i.e. the set of activation patterns of neuron i in the hidden layer fora fixed X and Ki = {u \u2208 Rd : (2Di \u2212 I)Xu \u227d 0} is a convex cone; and setting{W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190SDi\u2208D\u2032 {(v\u22c6i , 1) :v\u22c6i \u0338= 0)} \u222a {(u\u22c6i , \u22121) :u\u22c6i \u0338= 0)}, \u2200k \u2208 [m], k > m\u22c6,(0, 0), otherwisefor some m\u22c6 s.t. m > m\u22c6 and m\u22c6 \u2264 n + 1.This leads to solving a practically intractable quadratic program for large d as |DX| \u2208 O(r(nr )r)where r = rank(X) \u2264 d < n. Instead, we solve an unconstrained version of the above problem:Theorem 2 (Convex equivalence for GReLU networks). Let G \u2282Rd and \u03d5g(X, u) =diag(1 (Xg \u22650))Xu denote the gated ReLU (GReLU) activation function. Then the modelhGReLUW1,w2 (X) =Xg\u2208G\u03d5g(XW1i)w2iis a GReLU network where each g is a fixed gate. Let gi \u2208 Rd such that diag(Xgi \u2265 0) = Diand G\u2032 = {gi : Di \u2208 DX}. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 for the regularized convex lossfunction can be obtained by solving the following convex optimization problem:minvLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiXvi, y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX\u2225vi\u22252, (2)and setting {W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190nvi\u22c6\u221a\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225,p\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225o\u2200i.The main difference between Theorem 2 and Theorem 1 is the activation function. Using fixedgates g, the activation function \u03d5g(X, W1i) is linear in W1i and the non-linearity introduced by thegating matrix is fixed with respect to the optimization variables W1 and w2. Since each term in theoptimization problem involves a product of \u03d5gi(XW1i) and w2i, it is bilinear in W1i and w2i. Atfirst glance, this may suggest that the optimization is non-convex as bilinear functions are generallynon-convex. However, in this specific case, we can transform the problem into a convex one throughreparameterization (specifically, set vi = W1iw2i). (For details, see Section A.1)One can show that the solutions to the optimization problems in Theorems 2 and 1 are guaranteedto approximate each other if the number of samples is sufficiently large. Kim and Pilanci (2024)show that under certain assumptions on the input data On/d \xb7 log nGaussian gates are sufficient4--- Page 5 ---for local gradient methods to converge with high probability to a stationary point that is O(\u221alog n)relative approximation of the global optimum of the non-convex problem. Lastly, note that the abovetheorems are hold only for scalar outputs, and by extension, binary classification problems. Mishkinet al. (2022) extend the above theorems to vector valued outputs by using a one-vs-all approach foreach entry in the output vector and the following reformulation:Theorem 3 (Convex equivalence for vector output networks). Let C be the model output dimension,Y \u2208 Rn\xd7C the associated targets, and W2 \u2208 RC\xd7m the weights of the second layer. Then,A. The two-layer ReLU neural network with vector output can be expressed as:hReLUW1,W2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)WT2i,and the optimal weights W\u22c61 and W\u22c62 can recovered by solving the following one-vs-all convexoptimization problem:min{vk,uk}Ck=1Lconvex CXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vik \u2212 uik)eTk , Y+ \u03bbCXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vik\u22252 + \u2225uik\u22252),(3)s.t.

The two-layer GReLU neural network with vector output and the corresponding convex optimiza-tion problem can be expressed similarly to the above except with the change thatPmi=1 ReLU(XW1i)is replaced by Pg\u2208G \u03d5g(XW1,i) in the statements and the constrained nuclear norm penalty beingreplaced with a standard nuclear norm penalty.Further, works by Gupta et al. (2021); Sahiner et al. (2021; 2022a;b) have extended this convexreformulation to modules prevalent in deep neural networks such as convolution layers, batchnormalization, self-attention transformers etc.4 Approach: Distillation via Activation Matching4.1 Distilling Vision Classification Models using Convex Networks.478.376 .169.263.674.456 .134 .223.122.326channel012r ow0 1 2.255 .231 .342.124.232.123.194 .202 .275 column012Input: xOutput: ymodel.Block1CNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL Umodel.Block2 model.Block3z xf S (z x )f T (z x )model.Block4T eacher (T)Student (S)model.f cF r o z en model la y ersDistilled la y ersoutput activ ationinput activ ationz xinput activ ationReL U+xReL UBatch norm3 x 3 Conv3 x 3 ConvBatch normFigure 1: For Resnet18 architecture, we first distill Block4 by training our convex block (orange) over input-output activations dataset. Post-training, we simply swap out the exisiting non-convex block and replace it withour convex block. Note that all other layers are kept frozen (marked in purple).Consider a Model M that has been trained on a dataset DTrain := {xTraini , yTraini }Ni=1 drawn from thedata distribution D. As discussed previously, one common way to compress the model size is toprune the architecture, say via magnitude thresholding, and get rid of redundant or non-contributingweights across the DNN layers. In our case, we will focus on compressing the upper blocks of themodel where each block itself can comprise of multiple layers of varying kinds such as Convolution,Batchnorm, Pooling, MLP, etc. We refer to the (original) block that we want to compress as Teacher(T ) and the post-distillation resulting block to be Student (S). We use these terms to conceptuallyrelate to the nomenclature prevalent in distillation literature.5--- Page 6 ---Let the set of input activations just before the Teacher block T generated by inferencing the M witha single pass over a dataset D \u223c Dbe {zx}. Let the output functions of T and S blocks be denotedby fT (\xb7) and fS(\xb7) respectively. Then we can distill the knowledge of T onto S by minimizing thefollowing activation matching objective:Ldistil = Ex,y\u223cDh\u2225fT (zx) \u2212 fS(zx)\u222522i, (5)i.e., we enforce the new block S to learn the input-output activation value mapping over the datadistribution. In practice however, we find the optimal weights of S by solving the following ERM:Ldistil(DTrain) =Xxi,yi\u2208DTrain\u2225fT (zxi) \u2212 fS(zxi)\u222522. (6)Once we have trained S with activation matching, we simply swap out T with S. Post replacement,we do not perform any fine-tuning of any other parameter of the model using the training dataset. Infact, all other layers in the model are kept frozen with their original weights and we directly performtest time inference (see Figure 4.1). Note how this approach is label free as there is no explicitdependency on the output y in the optimization problem. The only design constraint for S is that thedimensions of input-output of S should exactly match the dimensions for the input-output activationsof the original block T , i.e., dim(fS(\xb7)) =dim(fT (\xb7)).Unlike other distillation methods that preserve non-convexity our approach gets rid of any non-convexity in the constituent layers of S. For instance, consider Figure 4.1 where the number ofparameters in T increase significantly as we move from Block #1 to Block #4 ((see Table 4.1). Block#4 of Resnet18 alone contributes roughly 70% of the total model size and compressing it to \u2248 1/8-thits size compresses the overall model by60%. Each block in Resnet18 has multiple CNN, Batchnorm,AvgPool, and ReLU layers which results in sophisticated non-convex model with high expressivity.Table 1: Comparison of number of parameters in the 4 Blocks of Renset18 model. d and C denote the inputand output activation dimensions for each Block. The last two columns denote to what degree distilling a blocks(S) to a fixed parameter count compresses that particular block as well as the overall model.RESNET BLOCK INPUT DIM (d) OUTPUT DIM (C) #PARAMS(T) #PARAMS(S) SPARSITYBLOCK OVERALLBLOCK1 64\xd78 \xd78 64\xd78 \xd78 147,968 73,328 0.495 0.994BLOCK2 64\xd78 \xd78 128\xd74 \xd74 525,568 164,608 0.313 0.969BLOCK3 128\xd74 \xd74 256\xd72 \xd72 2,099,712 656,896 0.313 0.8765BLOCK4 256\xd72 \xd72 512\xd71 \xd71 8,393,728 1,312,768 0.156 0.394.We now describe how to construct a convexS. Note that AvgPool is a linear operator and thereforepreserves convexity. Furthermore, training regularized ReLU networks with Batchnorm can bereformulated as a finite-dimensional convex problem (Ergen et al., 2022b). Therefore, a compositionof these operations is still a convex operation. Now, the non-convexity ofT stems primarily from thecomposition of multiple ReLU layers inside the block. Consider the simplified functional expressionof the teacher module where we omit all the Batchnorm and AvgPool layers, fT (zx) = t\u25e6k(zx),wheret(z) =CNN2ReLU(CNN1(z)), (7)i.e., T is the composition of k smaller 2-CNN layer ReLU networks (t(\xb7)) and k is a fixed numberthat depends on actual the model architecture.To distill this via convex models, we will setS to be a 3-CNN layer block such that:fS(zx) =CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 1 (CNN1(zx) > 0). (8)Remarks on the convexity ofS: In Sahiner et al., it is shown that the above architecture corresponds tothe Burer-Monteiro factorization of the convex NN objective in equation 4 for vector outputs, and alllocal minima are globally optimal (see Theorem 3.3 in Sahiner et al.). Also note (i) 1 (CNN1(z) > 0)is a boolean mask that masks out the corresponding entries in the outputs ofCNN2(z). Since the maskvalues are {0, 1}, no gradient is back-propagated to the parameters of CNN1, it does not contributeany effective parameter to the model size. Alternatively, we can mask out CNN2(z) using fixedboolean masks. (ii) CNN2(z) is the main output generating layer. iii) CNN1\xd713 is 1 \xd7 1 filter whichis used to ensure that the shapes of fT (zx) and sT (zx) match. Observe that it was not necessaryfor S in this example to be composed of CNN layers. In fact, any block that matches input-outputactivation dimensions, irrespective of the architecture design, could have been used.6--- Page 7 ---4.2 Accelerating Distillation using Convex SolversIn the previous subsection, we discussed how one can compress a large model by distilling its largenon-convex modules into smaller convex modules. When the optimization problem is convex, saddlepoints and non- global minima do not exist, facilitating faster convergence even with momentum-basedoptimization methods (Assran and Rabbat, 2020). Therefore, convex formulations can acceleratethe test-time fine-tuning of the compressed model in presence of new data when compared to theirnon-convex counterparts. To push these benefits to the limit, we employ fast convex solvers.Given that the only constraint on S is matching the shape of the input-output activations with T , wedraw inspiration from the work of Mishkin et al. (2022) on 2-layer convex and non-convex MLPmodels, and setup S as a 2-layer GReLU MLP along the lines of Theorems 2 and 3. While wedemonstrate the effects of convexity when using standard optimtizers like Adam (Paszke et al., 2019)to train S, solving the resulting group lasso regression can be more efficiently handled by specializedconvex optimization algorithms. The SCNN Python library 1 provides fast and reliable algorithms forconvex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Specifically, itimplements the R-FISTA algorithm, an improved version of the FISTA algorithm (Beck and Teboulle,2009), which combines line search, careful step-size initialization, and data normalization to enhanceconvergence. We utilized R-FISTA as the convex solver in this paper.4.3 Improving Convex Solvers Via PolishingW 1 1 W 2 1 W 2 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 2 Figure 2: To improve SCNN\u2019s one-vs-all solution, we freezeW\u22c61 but recompute W\u22c62 for equation 6 by enforcing informa-tion sharing (red lines) across the constituent W1i\u2019s.While the SCNN package is optimized forscalar outputs, it handles vector output op-timization problems by adopting a one-vs-all approach for each output dimension, i.e.return WT2 \u2190 [w21, w22, . . . ,w2C]m\xd7Cwhere each w2i \u2208 Rm. This inhibits anyinformation sharing between the weightmatrices corresponding to different nodesin the multi-dimensional model output. Toovercome this, we can explicitly impose in-formation sharing between the weight ma-trices w2js, and in the process arguablyobtain a better solution for W2 an evensparse solution for W1, leading to possi-bility of further model compression. Oneway to do this is to freeze the stacked W1matrices computed by SCNN and recompute W\u22c62 (initialized with W2 obtained from SCNN) butwith a group elastic constraint on rows of W2 (See Appendix A.2 for the mathematical setup). Usinga group elastic constraint on the "shared" W2 regressor encourages using features from differentW1\u2019s and therefore acts as a feature selector. This essentially translates to zeroing-out entire columnsof W1 and compress the model further. To implement this, we use the open source python packageAdelie2 that can solve the group elastic regression problem in a heavily parallelized manner.5 ExperimentsIn this section, we conduct an empirical study with the following goals: a) to demonstrate that usingconvex neural networks and distilling via convex optimization performs as well, if not better than,non-convex distillation; and b) to show that our approach generalizes well in low-sample regimeand that using convex solvers is an order of magnitude faster than training non-convex models. Weconsider the following baselines: 1) Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT) : The original full fine-tunedmodel (T ) undergoing compression, 2) Convex-Gated (Sconvex): learns a compressed block withconvex-gating activations, 3)Non-Convex (Snon-convex) learns a non-convex compressed block withReLU activation, and 4) Pruning (Sprune): prunes the weights in T . We set the compressed blocksSnon-convex and Sprune s.t. they have the same parameter count as in Sconvex. This enables a fairperformance comparison between each of the distillation methods. We use SVHN (Netzer et al.,2011), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009), TinyImagenet (Le and Yang, 2015), and VisualWake Words (Chowdhery et al., 2019) datasets to establish the validity of our approach.1https://pypi.org/project/pyscnn/2https://jamesyang007.github.io/adelie/index.html7--- Page 8 ---5.1 Convex Distillation of CNN Blocks using standard optimizersFirst, we measure the performance of KD based compressed blocks, as described in Section 4.1, bycomparing the effects of convexity and non-convexity in the design ofS:Snon-convex = CNN2ReLU(CNN1(zx)), Sconvex = CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 (CNN1(zx) > 0),and optimizing the Mean Squared Error as Lconvex in equation 6 using Adam Optimizer. For bothmethods, we incorporate BatchNorm and AvgPool layers in the architecture since they preserveconvexity and lead to improved results. To obtain different compression rates when distilling theblocks (reported as X times the original model size), we vary the number of filters of CNN2 in Sconvexfrom 1 to 512 in multiples of 2. Then, for a fair comparison, we adjust the number of filters inthe CNN layers of Snon-convex to match the parameter count of Sconvex. Since CNN1 provides only aboolean mask and has no gradient back-propagated to it, and CNN3 is a 1 \xd7 1 convolution layer,typically for the same number of filters, #\u03b8non-convex \u2248 2 \xd7 #\u03b8convex.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Renset18 on SVHN: 10-Way ClassificationOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation (Snon convex)(a) Test Accuracies on the SVHN dataset when com-pressing only the fourth CNN block.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Resent18 CIFAR10 with 100 Train Samples/ClassOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)(b) Full Test Set Accuracies when given only 100training samples per class in CIFAR10,Figure 3: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex performance comparisons in low-sample and high compression regimes.Figure 3a demonstrates the test-set accuracy versus total model size as we double the number offilters in the compressed Block 4 of ResNet-18 on the SVHN dataset. Note that in the extremelylow model size regime (number of filters = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), Sconvex significantly outperforms Snon-convex.On the CIFAR10 dataset, we also compress Block 3 along with Block 4 of Resnet18 by varying thenumber of filters in multiples of 2 from 1 to 512. We compare the performance of both Sconvex andSnon-convex against magnitude-based pruning, where we preserve a certain percentage of weights basedon their magnitude and zero out the remaining entries in the weight matrices.

The Black dotted line denotes the original fine-tuned model\u2019s performance onCIFAR10. In the leftmost subplot, we distill only Block 3, in the middle subplot only Block 4, and in the rightsubplot, we plug and play different combinations of the compressed blocks into the original model.Figure 4 demonstrates the efficacy of our Sconvex v/s Snon-convex on CIFAR10 dataset. All subplotscompare the test set accuracies without any post-compression training or fine-tuning on the labeleddataset. Note that utilizing the compressed versions for both Blocks 3 and 4 leads to \u223c10x compres-sion compared to the original fine-tuned model in size, with no significant drop in performance on the8--- Page 9 ---full test set. The figure shows that while both Sconvex and Snon-convex perform well when distilling onlyBlock 3, Sconvex outperforms Snon-convex when distilling Block 4, especially at higher compressionrates. This becomes more evident as we use different compressed combinations of both Blocks 3 & 4.Next, we consider the performance of Sconvex and Snon-convex in the low-sample regime. We train bothSconvex and Snon-convex (compressing Block 4) using only 100 randomly selected training samples perclass and compare their performance on the full dataset (\u223c 25K samples) against the Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on original training dataset. Figure 3b shows that performance gap between Sconvex andSnon-convex is even more prominent in this data-scarce regime.So far, we have used the Adam optimizer to train both the convex and non-convex compressed blocksin these experiments. In the subsequent experiments, we leverage fast convex solvers for distillation.5.2 Fast Distillation Using Convex Solvers10 2 10 1 100Time (seconds)0.500.550.600.650.700.750.80T est AccuracyDifferent Optimization Routines distilling Resnet18 for TinyImagenetOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Augmented Lagrangian (AL) for (Sconvex)RFISTA (Sconvex)Approx.

We use the SCNN library to solve theactivation-matching problem for Sconvex and theAdam optimizer for the Snon-convex block. Thetime budget for Adam is set slightly higher thanthat used by SCNN for a fair comparison. Recallthat having a convex optimization problem forSconvex gives us the liberty to choose any convexsolver, which requires minimal hand-tuning ofhyperparameters. Figure 5 compares differentconvex solvers when distilling a Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on a binary classification task in theTinyImageNet Dataset (german shephard v/s tabby cat) into Sconvex perform at test time. In thisDataset, we have 500 training and 100 test samples per class, representing a data-scarce regime. Fordistilling to Snon-convex, we use both full-batch and mini-batch training using Adam. The experimentis repeated over 10 different seeds, and we plot the error curves for each method, with the solidline representing the mean and the shaded region indicating twice the standard deviation. The plotshows that RFISTA and Approximate Cone Decomposition are superior among the convex solvers.In contrast, both versions of Adam-trained non-convex models take nearly one-two orders of moretime to reach the performance achieved by the convex solvers.0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05Time (seconds)2030405060708090T est Accuracy2.1M2.0M 1.9M 1.8M 1.6M 1.4M1.2M 1.0MOnly 1 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.5M1.8M 1.8M 1.7M 1.7M 1.6M 1.5M 1.3M 1.2M 1.1M 0.9MOnly 10 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.3M1.3M1.3M 1.3M 1.2M 1.2M 1.2MOnly 25 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)Regularization Path Acc for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 6: As we vary the number of training samples per class, we see that in extremely resource-constrainedsettings convex distillation does much better than non-convex distillation on the test set.Since SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem for vector outputs, for the 10-way classification problemof CIFAR10, we set the hidden dimension of the network to be 25, determine the total number ofnon-zero entries in the weight matrices computed by SCNN (using the RFISTA solver) and use thatto set the hidden layer size of the non-convex block. For an elaborate comparison between the twomethods, at each point of the regularization path computed by SCNN, we track the the time requiredby it to solve the activation matching problem and use that as a time budget for the Adam-basedSnon-convex training. We also impose constraints on the available number of training samples and report9--- Page 10 ---the test set accuracy of each method after swapping the distilled blocks back into the original model.Figure 6 shows the experiment results when we try to distill Block 4 from it\u2019s original 8M parametercount to \u223c1M at different training samples/class configurations. Note how in extreme labeled trainingdata scarce settings, convex distillation performs far better than non-convex distillation.5.3 Distillation via Proximal Gradient Methods followed by polishingOne may notice in Figure 6 that as we relax the constraints on the training time and the number oftraining samples available per class, non-convex NN seems to catch up to convex NN distillation.20 40 60 80 100#TrainSamples/Class76788082848688Complete T est Set AccuracyConvex AccNon-Convex AccFFT Accuracy @ #params = 8393728SCNN+Adelie+Polish for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 7: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex Test Accuracies when givenonly 100 training samples per class for activation matchingOne key reason is that SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem which inhibits any infor-mation sharing between the weight matri-ces corresponding to different nodes in themulti-dimensional model output. To over-come this, we recompute W\u22c62 by explic-itly imposing information sharing betweenthe constituent weight matrices (See Sec-tion 4.3). By obtaining a shared W2, werecover any performance lost due to ad-ditional compression by polishing and re-solving a regularized linear regression prob-lem. Figure 7 shows that even for relaxedresource constraints, convex optimizationbased distillation performs at least as good as with Adam-based non-convex block distillation. We be-lieve that here convex distillation approach would outperform non-convex distillation ifS comprisedof CNN layers instead of linear layers. Since SCNN only solves the training of 2-layer MLPs, we areconstrained by the types of experiments we can do.5.4 Beyond Distillation: End-To-End Fine-tuning of Convex ArchitecturesTable 2: Convex vs. Non-Convex: Visual Wake WordsBack-Bone Classification Head AccuracyFrozen Convex 81.36Frozen Non-Convex 80.84Trainable Convex 83.47Trainable Non-Convex 83.42As an ablation experiment, we study how con-vexity affects the fine-tuning of DNNs on la-beled training datasets. Visual Wake Words isa benchmark dataset derived from COCO Linet al. (2015) that assesses the performance oftiny vision models at the microcontroller scale(memory footprint of less than 250KB). For ourexperiment, we consider the Person/Not Persontask, where the vision model determines whethera person is present in the image. There are a total of \u223c115K images in the training and validationdataset \u223c 8k images in the test dataset. This task serves various edge machine learning use cases,such as in smart homes and retail stores, where we wish to detect the presence of specific objects ofinterest without a high inference cost. Using the ImageNet pre-trained MobileNet V3 model (Howardet al., 2019) as our base model, we preserve its back-bone upto the fourth layer and replace all thesubsequent layers with a smaller architecture as the classification head. The classification head canbe either convex or non-convex, as described in the previous experiments. We also consider scenarioswhere the back-bone is either kept frozen or trainable. We then fine-tune the resulting model on theCOCO dataset with Adam on Cross-Entropy Loss, and report the Test Accuracy in Table 2.When the back-bone is frozen, convex classification head performs noticeably better than its non-convex counterpart. This scenario represents a realistic situation where end-to-end fine-tuning of largemodels (e.g., large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs)) can be prohibitivelyexpensive for downstream tasks due to computational constraints. When the back-bone is trainable,i.e. all the parameters of the combined model can be updated during fine-tuning, using a convex headis very slightly better or nearly the same as a non-convex head. This experiment shows promise thatconvex NN architectures are good candidates for DNN applications beyond just distillation.6 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have introduced a novel approach that bridges the non-convex and convex regimesby combining the representational power of large non-convex DNNs with the favorable optimizationlandscape of convex NNs. Our experiments show that the disillation via convex architectures performs10--- Page 11 ---at least as good as prevalent non-convex distillation methods. Furthermore, our approach successfullydistill models in a completely label-free setting without requiring any post-compression fine-tuningon the training data. This work opens new avenues for deploying efficient, low-footprint modelson resource-constrained edge devices with on-device learning using online data. Future work couldfocus on developing convex optimization methods to directly solve for optimal weights withoutresorting to a one-vs-all setting for multi-dimensional outputs. Additionally, exploring applicationsin other domains, such as natural language processing and generative models, could further validateand expand the applicability of our approach.ReferencesWaseem Rawat and Zenghui Wang.

Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s).

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection.

Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications.

This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #22, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of DeepNetworks via Convex OptimizationPrateek Varshney Mert PilanciStanford University{vprateek,pilanci}@stanford.eduAbstractDeploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edgedevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and thecomplexities of non-convex optimization.

The performance of thesemodels typically scale with their size, width and architectural complexity, leading to the developmentof increasingly large models to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, this also necessitatessignificant computational, memory and energy resources to attain reasonable performance (Biancoet al., 2018; Rosenfeld, 2021); making their deployment impractical for resource-constrained edgedevices \u2013 such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and wearable technology \u2013 which are of daily use(Ignatov et al., 2019; Anwar and Raychowdhury, 2020; Seng et al., 2023; Chen and Liu, 2021). Edgedeep learning is crucial in these contexts to enable real-time processing, reduce latency, and ensurereliable operation without constant network connectivity (Kusupati et al., 2018; Tan and Le, 2019;V oghoei et al., 2018; Zaidi et al., 2022). Even in cases where such devices can make predictions byoffloading the the computations to large models on cloud servers, developing memory and computePreprint. Under review.arXiv:2410.06567v1  [cs.LG]  9 Oct 2024--- Page 2 ---efficient models is still advantageous as it reduces network bandwidth usage, lowers operational costs,and allows cloud services to serve more clients within the same resource constraints.Non-convex optimization, which forms the bedrock of training DNNs, poses significant theoreticaland practical challenges. Finding the global minimum can be NP-hard in the worst case and theoptimization landscape is riddled with local minima (Yao, 1992; Bartlett and Ben-David, 1999)and saddle points (Dauphin et al., 2014), making it difficult to guarantee convergence to a globaloptimum (Choromanska et al., 2015). Moreover, even training these models in a distributed manneron multiple GPUs can take days or weeks to complete. Convex optimization, on the other hand, iswell-studied with strong theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms (Boyd and Vandenberghe,2004). While there are recent works that show one can reformulate the optimization of certainclasses of non-convex NNs as convex problems (Pilanci and Ergen, 2020a; Ergen et al., 2022a),convex models are generally considered less expressive than their non-convex counterparts (Guss andSalakhutdinov, 2019; Scarselli and Chung Tsoi, 1998) and have been overshadowed by the successof deep learning in recent years.Although large non-convex DNNs possess immense expressive power, they often contain redundantweights that contribute little to the overall performance in downstream tasks (Frankle and Carbin,2019; Han et al., 2015). This phenomenon called Implicit Bias has been well established in boththeory and practice (Soudry et al., 2024; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Morwani et al., 2023; Shah et al.,2020). Additionally, while DNNs have the capacity to memorize the training dataset, they often endup learning basic solutions that generalize well to test datasets (Zhang et al., 2021). Both of theseobservations motivate using smaller, compressed models that eliminate unnecessary parameters whileachieving comparable performance. Common techniques for model compression include networkpruning (Han et al., 2015), low-rank approximation (Denil et al., 2013), and quantization (Gong et al.,2014). However, these methods often significantly degrade performance of the resulting model unlesssupplemented by another round of extensive fine-tuning on the labeled training data post-compression,which may not be feasible in many practical scenarios. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promisingalternative that enables a smaller student model to learn from a larger teacher model (Hinton et al.,2015) by training the student to mimic the outputs or intermediate representations of the teacher bymatching certain statistical metrics between the two models. While KD can significantly enhance theperformance of the student model, it often still requires fine-tuning the student model on labeled datain conjunction with the activation matching objective, limiting its applicability in situations wherelabeled data or compute is scarce or unavailable.In this paper, we bridge the gap between the non-convex and convex regimes by demonstrating thatconvex neural network architectures can achieve performance comparable to non-convex models fordownstream tasks when leveraging rich feature representations. To demonstrate this, we focus on themodel compression via KD framework and propose a novel approach that compresses non-convexDNNs via convex optimization. Our approach replaces the original complex non-convex layers inthe teacher module with simpler layers having convex gating functions in the student module. Bymatching the activation values between the teacher and student modules, we eliminate the needfor post-compression fine-tuning on labeled data, making our method suitable for deployment inenvironments where labeled data is scarce. Our method not only maintains the performance of theoriginal large model, but also capitalizes on the favorable optimization landscape of convex models.This enables users to employ a range of highly efficient and specialized convex solvers tailored totheir resource requirements, resulting in faster convergence and the potential for on-device learningusing online data\u2014a significant advantage for edge devices with limited computational resources.Summary of our Contributions:Efficient Convex-based Distillation and Deployment: We introduce a novel knowledge distillationapproach that leverages convex neural network architectures to compress DNNs. By replacing non-convex layers with convex gating functions in the student module, we exploit the well-understoodtheoretical foundations and efficient algorithms available in the convex optimization literature. Ourmethod achieves better performance than non-convex distillation approaches even when using thesame optimizer due to a more favorable optimization landscape. Moreover, the convexity of thestudent module allows us to employ faster and more specialized convex optimization algorithms,leading to accelerated convergence and reduced computational overhead. This facilitates real-timeexecution and on-device learning on resource-constrained edge devices.2--- Page 3 ---Label-Free Compression Without Fine-Tuning: Our method focuses on activation matchingbetween a larger non-convex teacher module and a smaller convex student module on unlabeleddata. We show that for many real-world tasks, convex distillation in itself sufficient for the resultingmodel to perform well at inference time, eliminating the need for any fine-tuning on labeled data aftercompression. This makes our approach applicable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce.Bridging the Non-Convex and Convex Regimes: To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork that marries the expressive representational power of non-convex DNNs with the theoreticaland computational advantages of convex architectures. Our empirical results on real-world datasetsdemonstrate that convex student models can achieve high compression rates without sacrificingaccuracy, often significantly outperforming non-convex compression methods in low-sample andhigh-compression regimes. This provides strong empirical evidence supporting the viability of convexneural networks when leveraging rich features from pre-trained non-convex teacher models, openingnew avenues for research at the intersection of deep learning and convex optimization.2 Other Related WorkKnowledge distillation (KD) has been a pivotal technique for compressing DNNs by transferringknowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this section, we discuss severalrelated methods, highlighting their advantages and the limitations that our approach addresses.In their seminal work, Romero et al. (2015) introduced FitNets, where a thin and wide studentmodel mimics the behavior of a larger teacher models by matching intermediate representations.By aligning the activations of a guided layer in the student with the outputs of the hint layer in theteacher, they prevent over-regularization and allow effective learning of the student on the trainingdataset. Since Fitnets were introduced, many methods have proposed modifications on top of them,such as designing new types of features (Kim et al., 2020; Srinivas and Fleuret, 2018), changingthe teacher/student architectures (Lee et al., 2022) and distilling across multiple layers (Chen et al.,2021). However, nearly all of them require access to labeled training data for fine-tuning, and theoptimization process remains non-convex, making convergence guarantees difficult.Tung and Mori (2019) proposed a method inspired by contrastive learning: preserve the relativerepresentational structure of the data in the student model by ensuring that input pairs that producesimilar (or dissimilar) activations in the teacher model produce similar (or dissimilar) activationsin the student network. This approach improves generalization but is computationally expensive,especially with large batch, due to the quadratic complexity of producing pairwise comparisons.Further, training objective is a weighted sum of cross entropy loss between the pairwise similarityactivations and a fine-tuning loss on the training data, necessitating access to labeled training data.Heo et al. (2018) introduced an activation transfer loss that minimizes the differences in booleanactivation patterns instead. This addresses the issue of the \u21132 loss emphasizing samples with largeactivation differences while underweighting those with small yet significant differences, which canmake it difficult to differentiate between weak and zero responses. However, their method involvesoptimizing a computationally intensive non-convex objective function.Recent advances have explored KD without access to the original training data. Yin et al. Raikwarand Mishra (2022) proposed generating synthetic data by sampling from a Gaussian distribution andadjusting the distributions within the teacher model\u2019s hidden layers. While this allows for label-freedistillation, the synthetic data may not capture the complexity of real data distributions. Additionally,their method relies on specific implementations of BatchNorm layers in the teacher model and focuseson label-free distillation without addressing the challenges of non-convex optimization. Since ourmethod is only concerned with intermediate activations and not the input-output nature of samples, itis also directly applicable on the synthetic data generated by their approach.3 Preliminaries3.1 Notation[m] denotes the set {1, 2, . . . , m}. For a matrix A, Ai denotes ith row of A. For a vector x, xidenotes ith element of x. We sometimes use xj to denote an indexed vector; in this case xj,i denotesthe ith element of xj. \u2225 \xb7 \u22252 denotes euclidean norm of a vector. For a sparse vector v \u2208 Rd, wedefine the support as supp(v) ={i \u2208 [d]|vi \u0338= 0}. We use I to denote the identity matrix and 1 (\xb7)3--- Page 4 ---to be the indicator function. For a matrix V \u2208 Rd\xd7r, vec(V) \u2208 Rdr vectorizes the matrix V bystacking columns sequentially. Unless stated otherwise, n is the number of samples in the trainingdataset and d is the dimenionality of the input samples.3.2 Convex Neural NetworksPilanci and Ergen (2020b) prove that training a two-layer fully-connected NNs with ReLU activationscan be reformulated as standard convex optimization problems. This result is important because itallows us to leverage convex optimization techniques while retaining the expressive power of DNNs.Theorem 1 (Convex equivalence for ReLU networks). Let X \u2208 Rn\xd7d be a data matrix and y \u2208 Rnthe associated scalar targets. The two-layer ReLU neural network can then be expressed as:hReLUW1,w2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)w2i,where W1 \u2208 Rm\xd7d, w2 \u2208 Rm are the weights of the first and second layers, m is the numberof hidden units, and ReLU(\xb7) is the ReLU activation. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 thatminimize the convex loss function Lconvex with a \u03bb-\u21132 regularization penalty can be obtained by firstsolving the following optimization problem:minv,uLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vi \u2212 ui), y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vi\u22252 + \u2225ui\u22252), s.t. vi, ui \u2208 Ki, (1)where sub-sampling is over neurons i \u2208 [m], DX = {D = diag(1 (Xu \u2265 0)) :u \u2208 Rd} is the set ofhyperplane arrangement patterns i.e. the set of activation patterns of neuron i in the hidden layer fora fixed X and Ki = {u \u2208 Rd : (2Di \u2212 I)Xu \u227d 0} is a convex cone; and setting{W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190SDi\u2208D\u2032 {(v\u22c6i , 1) :v\u22c6i \u0338= 0)} \u222a {(u\u22c6i , \u22121) :u\u22c6i \u0338= 0)}, \u2200k \u2208 [m], k > m\u22c6,(0, 0), otherwisefor some m\u22c6 s.t. m > m\u22c6 and m\u22c6 \u2264 n + 1.This leads to solving a practically intractable quadratic program for large d as |DX| \u2208 O(r(nr )r)where r = rank(X) \u2264 d < n. Instead, we solve an unconstrained version of the above problem:Theorem 2 (Convex equivalence for GReLU networks). Let G \u2282Rd and \u03d5g(X, u) =diag(1 (Xg \u22650))Xu denote the gated ReLU (GReLU) activation function. Then the modelhGReLUW1,w2 (X) =Xg\u2208G\u03d5g(XW1i)w2iis a GReLU network where each g is a fixed gate. Let gi \u2208 Rd such that diag(Xgi \u2265 0) = Diand G\u2032 = {gi : Di \u2208 DX}. Then, the optimal weights W\u22c61 and w\u22c62 for the regularized convex lossfunction can be obtained by solving the following convex optimization problem:minvLconvex XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiXvi, y+ \u03bbXDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX\u2225vi\u22252, (2)and setting {W\u22c61k, w\u22c62k} \u2190nvi\u22c6\u221a\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225,p\u2225vi\u22c6\u2225o\u2200i.The main difference between Theorem 2 and Theorem 1 is the activation function. Using fixedgates g, the activation function \u03d5g(X, W1i) is linear in W1i and the non-linearity introduced by thegating matrix is fixed with respect to the optimization variables W1 and w2. Since each term in theoptimization problem involves a product of \u03d5gi(XW1i) and w2i, it is bilinear in W1i and w2i. Atfirst glance, this may suggest that the optimization is non-convex as bilinear functions are generallynon-convex. However, in this specific case, we can transform the problem into a convex one throughreparameterization (specifically, set vi = W1iw2i). (For details, see Section A.1)One can show that the solutions to the optimization problems in Theorems 2 and 1 are guaranteedto approximate each other if the number of samples is sufficiently large. Kim and Pilanci (2024)show that under certain assumptions on the input data On/d \xb7 log nGaussian gates are sufficient4--- Page 5 ---for local gradient methods to converge with high probability to a stationary point that is O(\u221alog n)relative approximation of the global optimum of the non-convex problem. Lastly, note that the abovetheorems are hold only for scalar outputs, and by extension, binary classification problems. Mishkinet al. (2022) extend the above theorems to vector valued outputs by using a one-vs-all approach foreach entry in the output vector and the following reformulation:Theorem 3 (Convex equivalence for vector output networks). Let C be the model output dimension,Y \u2208 Rn\xd7C the associated targets, and W2 \u2208 RC\xd7m the weights of the second layer. Then,A. The two-layer ReLU neural network with vector output can be expressed as:hReLUW1,W2 (X) =mXi=1ReLU(XW1i)WT2i,and the optimal weights W\u22c61 and W\u22c62 can recovered by solving the following one-vs-all convexoptimization problem:min{vk,uk}Ck=1Lconvex CXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2286DXDiX(vik \u2212 uik)eTk , Y+ \u03bbCXk=1XDi\u2208D\u2032\u2208DX(\u2225vik\u22252 + \u2225uik\u22252),(3)s.t. (2Di \u2212 In)Xvik \u227d 0, (2Di \u2212 In)Xuik \u227d 0. (4)B. The two-layer GReLU neural network with vector output and the corresponding convex optimiza-tion problem can be expressed similarly to the above except with the change thatPmi=1 ReLU(XW1i)is replaced by Pg\u2208G \u03d5g(XW1,i) in the statements and the constrained nuclear norm penalty beingreplaced with a standard nuclear norm penalty.Further, works by Gupta et al. (2021); Sahiner et al. (2021; 2022a;b) have extended this convexreformulation to modules prevalent in deep neural networks such as convolution layers, batchnormalization, self-attention transformers etc.4 Approach: Distillation via Activation Matching4.1 Distilling Vision Classification Models using Convex Networks.478.376 .169.263.674.456 .134 .223.122.326channel012r ow0 1 2.255 .231 .342.124.232.123.194 .202 .275 column012Input: xOutput: ymodel.Block1CNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL UCNN Block with ReL Umodel.Block2 model.Block3z xf S (z x )f T (z x )model.Block4T eacher (T)Student (S)model.f cF r o z en model la y ersDistilled la y ersoutput activ ationinput activ ationz xinput activ ationReL U+xReL UBatch norm3 x 3 Conv3 x 3 ConvBatch normFigure 1: For Resnet18 architecture, we first distill Block4 by training our convex block (orange) over input-output activations dataset. Post-training, we simply swap out the exisiting non-convex block and replace it withour convex block. Note that all other layers are kept frozen (marked in purple).Consider a Model M that has been trained on a dataset DTrain := {xTraini , yTraini }Ni=1 drawn from thedata distribution D. As discussed previously, one common way to compress the model size is toprune the architecture, say via magnitude thresholding, and get rid of redundant or non-contributingweights across the DNN layers. In our case, we will focus on compressing the upper blocks of themodel where each block itself can comprise of multiple layers of varying kinds such as Convolution,Batchnorm, Pooling, MLP, etc. We refer to the (original) block that we want to compress as Teacher(T ) and the post-distillation resulting block to be Student (S). We use these terms to conceptuallyrelate to the nomenclature prevalent in distillation literature.5--- Page 6 ---Let the set of input activations just before the Teacher block T generated by inferencing the M witha single pass over a dataset D \u223c Dbe {zx}. Let the output functions of T and S blocks be denotedby fT (\xb7) and fS(\xb7) respectively. Then we can distill the knowledge of T onto S by minimizing thefollowing activation matching objective:Ldistil = Ex,y\u223cDh\u2225fT (zx) \u2212 fS(zx)\u222522i, (5)i.e., we enforce the new block S to learn the input-output activation value mapping over the datadistribution. In practice however, we find the optimal weights of S by solving the following ERM:Ldistil(DTrain) =Xxi,yi\u2208DTrain\u2225fT (zxi) \u2212 fS(zxi)\u222522. (6)Once we have trained S with activation matching, we simply swap out T with S. Post replacement,we do not perform any fine-tuning of any other parameter of the model using the training dataset. Infact, all other layers in the model are kept frozen with their original weights and we directly performtest time inference (see Figure 4.1). Note how this approach is label free as there is no explicitdependency on the output y in the optimization problem. The only design constraint for S is that thedimensions of input-output of S should exactly match the dimensions for the input-output activationsof the original block T , i.e., dim(fS(\xb7)) =dim(fT (\xb7)).Unlike other distillation methods that preserve non-convexity our approach gets rid of any non-convexity in the constituent layers of S. For instance, consider Figure 4.1 where the number ofparameters in T increase significantly as we move from Block #1 to Block #4 ((see Table 4.1). Block#4 of Resnet18 alone contributes roughly 70% of the total model size and compressing it to \u2248 1/8-thits size compresses the overall model by60%. Each block in Resnet18 has multiple CNN, Batchnorm,AvgPool, and ReLU layers which results in sophisticated non-convex model with high expressivity.Table 1: Comparison of number of parameters in the 4 Blocks of Renset18 model. d and C denote the inputand output activation dimensions for each Block. The last two columns denote to what degree distilling a blocks(S) to a fixed parameter count compresses that particular block as well as the overall model.RESNET BLOCK INPUT DIM (d) OUTPUT DIM (C) #PARAMS(T) #PARAMS(S) SPARSITYBLOCK OVERALLBLOCK1 64\xd78 \xd78 64\xd78 \xd78 147,968 73,328 0.495 0.994BLOCK2 64\xd78 \xd78 128\xd74 \xd74 525,568 164,608 0.313 0.969BLOCK3 128\xd74 \xd74 256\xd72 \xd72 2,099,712 656,896 0.313 0.8765BLOCK4 256\xd72 \xd72 512\xd71 \xd71 8,393,728 1,312,768 0.156 0.394.We now describe how to construct a convexS. Note that AvgPool is a linear operator and thereforepreserves convexity. Furthermore, training regularized ReLU networks with Batchnorm can bereformulated as a finite-dimensional convex problem (Ergen et al., 2022b). Therefore, a compositionof these operations is still a convex operation. Now, the non-convexity ofT stems primarily from thecomposition of multiple ReLU layers inside the block. Consider the simplified functional expressionof the teacher module where we omit all the Batchnorm and AvgPool layers, fT (zx) = t\u25e6k(zx),wheret(z) =CNN2ReLU(CNN1(z)), (7)i.e., T is the composition of k smaller 2-CNN layer ReLU networks (t(\xb7)) and k is a fixed numberthat depends on actual the model architecture.To distill this via convex models, we will setS to be a 3-CNN layer block such that:fS(zx) =CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 1 (CNN1(zx) > 0). (8)Remarks on the convexity ofS: In Sahiner et al., it is shown that the above architecture corresponds tothe Burer-Monteiro factorization of the convex NN objective in equation 4 for vector outputs, and alllocal minima are globally optimal (see Theorem 3.3 in Sahiner et al.). Also note (i) 1 (CNN1(z) > 0)is a boolean mask that masks out the corresponding entries in the outputs ofCNN2(z). Since the maskvalues are {0, 1}, no gradient is back-propagated to the parameters of CNN1, it does not contributeany effective parameter to the model size. Alternatively, we can mask out CNN2(z) using fixedboolean masks. (ii) CNN2(z) is the main output generating layer. iii) CNN1\xd713 is 1 \xd7 1 filter whichis used to ensure that the shapes of fT (zx) and sT (zx) match. Observe that it was not necessaryfor S in this example to be composed of CNN layers. In fact, any block that matches input-outputactivation dimensions, irrespective of the architecture design, could have been used.6--- Page 7 ---4.2 Accelerating Distillation using Convex SolversIn the previous subsection, we discussed how one can compress a large model by distilling its largenon-convex modules into smaller convex modules. When the optimization problem is convex, saddlepoints and non- global minima do not exist, facilitating faster convergence even with momentum-basedoptimization methods (Assran and Rabbat, 2020). Therefore, convex formulations can acceleratethe test-time fine-tuning of the compressed model in presence of new data when compared to theirnon-convex counterparts. To push these benefits to the limit, we employ fast convex solvers.Given that the only constraint on S is matching the shape of the input-output activations with T , wedraw inspiration from the work of Mishkin et al. (2022) on 2-layer convex and non-convex MLPmodels, and setup S as a 2-layer GReLU MLP along the lines of Theorems 2 and 3. While wedemonstrate the effects of convexity when using standard optimtizers like Adam (Paszke et al., 2019)to train S, solving the resulting group lasso regression can be more efficiently handled by specializedconvex optimization algorithms. The SCNN Python library 1 provides fast and reliable algorithms forconvex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. Specifically, itimplements the R-FISTA algorithm, an improved version of the FISTA algorithm (Beck and Teboulle,2009), which combines line search, careful step-size initialization, and data normalization to enhanceconvergence. We utilized R-FISTA as the convex solver in this paper.4.3 Improving Convex Solvers Via PolishingW 1 1 W 2 1 W 2 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 1 d o u t W 2 Figure 2: To improve SCNN\u2019s one-vs-all solution, we freezeW\u22c61 but recompute W\u22c62 for equation 6 by enforcing informa-tion sharing (red lines) across the constituent W1i\u2019s.While the SCNN package is optimized forscalar outputs, it handles vector output op-timization problems by adopting a one-vs-all approach for each output dimension, i.e.return WT2 \u2190 [w21, w22, . . . ,w2C]m\xd7Cwhere each w2i \u2208 Rm. This inhibits anyinformation sharing between the weightmatrices corresponding to different nodesin the multi-dimensional model output. Toovercome this, we can explicitly impose in-formation sharing between the weight ma-trices w2js, and in the process arguablyobtain a better solution for W2 an evensparse solution for W1, leading to possi-bility of further model compression. Oneway to do this is to freeze the stacked W1matrices computed by SCNN and recompute W\u22c62 (initialized with W2 obtained from SCNN) butwith a group elastic constraint on rows of W2 (See Appendix A.2 for the mathematical setup). Usinga group elastic constraint on the "shared" W2 regressor encourages using features from differentW1\u2019s and therefore acts as a feature selector. This essentially translates to zeroing-out entire columnsof W1 and compress the model further. To implement this, we use the open source python packageAdelie2 that can solve the group elastic regression problem in a heavily parallelized manner.5 ExperimentsIn this section, we conduct an empirical study with the following goals: a) to demonstrate that usingconvex neural networks and distilling via convex optimization performs as well, if not better than,non-convex distillation; and b) to show that our approach generalizes well in low-sample regimeand that using convex solvers is an order of magnitude faster than training non-convex models. Weconsider the following baselines: 1) Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT) : The original full fine-tunedmodel (T ) undergoing compression, 2) Convex-Gated (Sconvex): learns a compressed block withconvex-gating activations, 3)Non-Convex (Snon-convex) learns a non-convex compressed block withReLU activation, and 4) Pruning (Sprune): prunes the weights in T . We set the compressed blocksSnon-convex and Sprune s.t. they have the same parameter count as in Sconvex. This enables a fairperformance comparison between each of the distillation methods. We use SVHN (Netzer et al.,2011), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009), TinyImagenet (Le and Yang, 2015), and VisualWake Words (Chowdhery et al., 2019) datasets to establish the validity of our approach.1https://pypi.org/project/pyscnn/2https://jamesyang007.github.io/adelie/index.html7--- Page 8 ---5.1 Convex Distillation of CNN Blocks using standard optimizersFirst, we measure the performance of KD based compressed blocks, as described in Section 4.1, bycomparing the effects of convexity and non-convexity in the design ofS:Snon-convex = CNN2ReLU(CNN1(zx)), Sconvex = CNN1\xd713CNN2(zx) \u2299 (CNN1(zx) > 0),and optimizing the Mean Squared Error as Lconvex in equation 6 using Adam Optimizer. For bothmethods, we incorporate BatchNorm and AvgPool layers in the architecture since they preserveconvexity and lead to improved results. To obtain different compression rates when distilling theblocks (reported as X times the original model size), we vary the number of filters of CNN2 in Sconvexfrom 1 to 512 in multiples of 2. Then, for a fair comparison, we adjust the number of filters inthe CNN layers of Snon-convex to match the parameter count of Sconvex. Since CNN1 provides only aboolean mask and has no gradient back-propagated to it, and CNN3 is a 1 \xd7 1 convolution layer,typically for the same number of filters, #\u03b8non-convex \u2248 2 \xd7 #\u03b8convex.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Renset18 on SVHN: 10-Way ClassificationOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation (Snon convex)(a) Test Accuracies on the SVHN dataset when com-pressing only the fourth CNN block.0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)2030405060708090T est AccuracyAccuracy vs Compression for Resent18 CIFAR10 with 100 Train Samples/ClassOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Block 4 Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Block 4 Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)(b) Full Test Set Accuracies when given only 100training samples per class in CIFAR10,Figure 3: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex performance comparisons in low-sample and high compression regimes.Figure 3a demonstrates the test-set accuracy versus total model size as we double the number offilters in the compressed Block 4 of ResNet-18 on the SVHN dataset. Note that in the extremelylow model size regime (number of filters = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16), Sconvex significantly outperforms Snon-convex.On the CIFAR10 dataset, we also compress Block 3 along with Block 4 of Resnet18 by varying thenumber of filters in multiples of 2 from 1 to 512. We compare the performance of both Sconvex andSnon-convex against magnitude-based pruning, where we preserve a certain percentage of weights basedon their magnitude and zero out the remaining entries in the weight matrices. We then swap differentcombinations of the compressed versions of Blocks 3 and 4 into the original model.0.82 0.84 0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlock 3 Convex DistillationBlock 3 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 3 Vanilla Pruning Distillation0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlock 4 Convex DistillationBlock 4 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 4 Vanilla Pruning Distillation0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45Compression Factor (w.r.t T otal Model Size)102030405060708090AccuracyBlocks 3+4 Convex DistillationBlocks 3+4 Non-Convex DistillationBlock 3+4 Vanilla Pruning DistillationAccuracy vs Compression for CIFAR10: 10-Way ClassificationFigure 4: Performance comparisons of all three distillation methods on Blocks 3, 4, and their combinations, ofthe Resnet18 model on CIFAR10. The Black dotted line denotes the original fine-tuned model\u2019s performance onCIFAR10. In the leftmost subplot, we distill only Block 3, in the middle subplot only Block 4, and in the rightsubplot, we plug and play different combinations of the compressed blocks into the original model.Figure 4 demonstrates the efficacy of our Sconvex v/s Snon-convex on CIFAR10 dataset. All subplotscompare the test set accuracies without any post-compression training or fine-tuning on the labeleddataset. Note that utilizing the compressed versions for both Blocks 3 and 4 leads to \u223c10x compres-sion compared to the original fine-tuned model in size, with no significant drop in performance on the8--- Page 9 ---full test set. The figure shows that while both Sconvex and Snon-convex perform well when distilling onlyBlock 3, Sconvex outperforms Snon-convex when distilling Block 4, especially at higher compressionrates. This becomes more evident as we use different compressed combinations of both Blocks 3 & 4.Next, we consider the performance of Sconvex and Snon-convex in the low-sample regime. We train bothSconvex and Snon-convex (compressing Block 4) using only 100 randomly selected training samples perclass and compare their performance on the full dataset (\u223c 25K samples) against the Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on original training dataset. Figure 3b shows that performance gap between Sconvex andSnon-convex is even more prominent in this data-scarce regime.So far, we have used the Adam optimizer to train both the convex and non-convex compressed blocksin these experiments. In the subsequent experiments, we leverage fast convex solvers for distillation.5.2 Fast Distillation Using Convex Solvers10 2 10 1 100Time (seconds)0.500.550.600.650.700.750.80T est AccuracyDifferent Optimization Routines distilling Resnet18 for TinyImagenetOriginal Full Fine-tuned Model (FFT)Augmented Lagrangian (AL) for (Sconvex)RFISTA (Sconvex)Approx.

We use the SCNN library to solve theactivation-matching problem for Sconvex and theAdam optimizer for the Snon-convex block. Thetime budget for Adam is set slightly higher thanthat used by SCNN for a fair comparison. Recallthat having a convex optimization problem forSconvex gives us the liberty to choose any convexsolver, which requires minimal hand-tuning ofhyperparameters. Figure 5 compares differentconvex solvers when distilling a Resnet18 modelfine-tuned on a binary classification task in theTinyImageNet Dataset (german shephard v/s tabby cat) into Sconvex perform at test time. In thisDataset, we have 500 training and 100 test samples per class, representing a data-scarce regime. Fordistilling to Snon-convex, we use both full-batch and mini-batch training using Adam. The experimentis repeated over 10 different seeds, and we plot the error curves for each method, with the solidline representing the mean and the shaded region indicating twice the standard deviation. The plotshows that RFISTA and Approximate Cone Decomposition are superior among the convex solvers.In contrast, both versions of Adam-trained non-convex models take nearly one-two orders of moretime to reach the performance achieved by the convex solvers.0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05Time (seconds)2030405060708090T est Accuracy2.1M2.0M 1.9M 1.8M 1.6M 1.4M1.2M 1.0MOnly 1 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.5M1.8M 1.8M 1.7M 1.7M 1.6M 1.5M 1.3M 1.2M 1.1M 0.9MOnly 10 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14Time (seconds)405060708090T est Accuracy1.3M1.3M1.3M 1.3M 1.2M 1.2M 1.2MOnly 25 train samples/classFFT Model @ #params = 8.4MSCNN based Convex Distillation (Sconvex)Non-Convex Distillation Snon convex)Regularization Path Acc for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 6: As we vary the number of training samples per class, we see that in extremely resource-constrainedsettings convex distillation does much better than non-convex distillation on the test set.Since SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem for vector outputs, for the 10-way classification problemof CIFAR10, we set the hidden dimension of the network to be 25, determine the total number ofnon-zero entries in the weight matrices computed by SCNN (using the RFISTA solver) and use thatto set the hidden layer size of the non-convex block. For an elaborate comparison between the twomethods, at each point of the regularization path computed by SCNN, we track the the time requiredby it to solve the activation matching problem and use that as a time budget for the Adam-basedSnon-convex training. We also impose constraints on the available number of training samples and report9--- Page 10 ---the test set accuracy of each method after swapping the distilled blocks back into the original model.Figure 6 shows the experiment results when we try to distill Block 4 from it\u2019s original 8M parametercount to \u223c1M at different training samples/class configurations. Note how in extreme labeled trainingdata scarce settings, convex distillation performs far better than non-convex distillation.5.3 Distillation via Proximal Gradient Methods followed by polishingOne may notice in Figure 6 that as we relax the constraints on the training time and the number oftraining samples available per class, non-convex NN seems to catch up to convex NN distillation.20 40 60 80 100#TrainSamples/Class76788082848688Complete T est Set AccuracyConvex AccNon-Convex AccFFT Accuracy @ #params = 8393728SCNN+Adelie+Polish for CIFAR: 10-Way Classification Block 4 DistillationFigure 7: Sconvex v/s Snon-convex Test Accuracies when givenonly 100 training samples per class for activation matchingOne key reason is that SCNN solves a one-vs-all problem which inhibits any infor-mation sharing between the weight matri-ces corresponding to different nodes in themulti-dimensional model output. To over-come this, we recompute W\u22c62 by explic-itly imposing information sharing betweenthe constituent weight matrices (See Sec-tion 4.3). By obtaining a shared W2, werecover any performance lost due to ad-ditional compression by polishing and re-solving a regularized linear regression prob-lem. Figure 7 shows that even for relaxedresource constraints, convex optimizationbased distillation performs at least as good as with Adam-based non-convex block distillation. We be-lieve that here convex distillation approach would outperform non-convex distillation ifS comprisedof CNN layers instead of linear layers. Since SCNN only solves the training of 2-layer MLPs, we areconstrained by the types of experiments we can do.5.4 Beyond Distillation: End-To-End Fine-tuning of Convex ArchitecturesTable 2: Convex vs. Non-Convex: Visual Wake WordsBack-Bone Classification Head AccuracyFrozen Convex 81.36Frozen Non-Convex 80.84Trainable Convex 83.47Trainable Non-Convex 83.42As an ablation experiment, we study how con-vexity affects the fine-tuning of DNNs on la-beled training datasets. Visual Wake Words isa benchmark dataset derived from COCO Linet al. (2015) that assesses the performance oftiny vision models at the microcontroller scale(memory footprint of less than 250KB). For ourexperiment, we consider the Person/Not Persontask, where the vision model determines whethera person is present in the image. There are a total of \u223c115K images in the training and validationdataset \u223c 8k images in the test dataset. This task serves various edge machine learning use cases,such as in smart homes and retail stores, where we wish to detect the presence of specific objects ofinterest without a high inference cost. Using the ImageNet pre-trained MobileNet V3 model (Howardet al., 2019) as our base model, we preserve its back-bone upto the fourth layer and replace all thesubsequent layers with a smaller architecture as the classification head. The classification head canbe either convex or non-convex, as described in the previous experiments. We also consider scenarioswhere the back-bone is either kept frozen or trainable. We then fine-tune the resulting model on theCOCO dataset with Adam on Cross-Entropy Loss, and report the Test Accuracy in Table 2.When the back-bone is frozen, convex classification head performs noticeably better than its non-convex counterpart. This scenario represents a realistic situation where end-to-end fine-tuning of largemodels (e.g., large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs)) can be prohibitivelyexpensive for downstream tasks due to computational constraints. When the back-bone is trainable,i.e. all the parameters of the combined model can be updated during fine-tuning, using a convex headis very slightly better or nearly the same as a non-convex head. This experiment shows promise thatconvex NN architectures are good candidates for DNN applications beyond just distillation.6 ConclusionsIn this paper, we have introduced a novel approach that bridges the non-convex and convex regimesby combining the representational power of large non-convex DNNs with the favorable optimizationlandscape of convex NNs. Our experiments show that the disillation via convex architectures performs10--- Page 11 ---at least as good as prevalent non-convex distillation methods. Furthermore, our approach successfullydistill models in a completely label-free setting without requiring any post-compression fine-tuningon the training data. This work opens new avenues for deploying efficient, low-footprint modelson resource-constrained edge devices with on-device learning using online data. Future work couldfocus on developing convex optimization methods to directly solve for optimal weights withoutresorting to a one-vs-all setting for multi-dimensional outputs. Additionally, exploring applicationsin other domains, such as natural language processing and generative models, could further validateand expand the applicability of our approach.ReferencesWaseem Rawat and Zenghui Wang.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net).

Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1).

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline. Our Inte-grated models perform similar or better than their corresponding baselines, with theadvantage of having a joint denoising and classification network. *See Suppl. A.2.Model Type Lat.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 6: The influence of altering the Conv operators in the DC-NAS M decoderto MBConv and scaling down the MBConv alternative by reducing the number ofoperators or decoder layers.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size. We co\n```\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance. We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers. On Pixel 4's Edge TPU, these models improve the\naccuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA mobile models.\nPublication Date: 2020-03-05\narXiv paper ID: 2003.02838v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: HyT-NAS: Hybrid Transformers Neural Architecture Search for Edge Devices\nSummary: Vision Transformers have enabled recent attention-based Deep Learning (DL)\narchitectures to achieve remarkable results in Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nHowever, due to the extensive computational resources required, these\narchitectures are rarely implemented on resource-constrained platforms. Current\nresearch investigates hybrid handcrafted convolution-based and attention-based\nmodels for CV tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this\npaper, we propose HyT-NAS, an efficient Hardware-aware Neural Architecture\nSearch (HW-NAS) including hybrid architectures targeting vision tasks on tiny\ndevices. HyT-NAS improves state-of-the-art HW-NAS by enriching the search space\nand enhancing the search strategy as well as the performance predictors. Our\nexperiments show that HyT-NAS achieves a similar hypervolume with less than ~5x\ntraining evaluations. Our resulting architecture outperforms MLPerf MobileNetV1\nby 6.3% accuracy improvement with 3.5x less number of parameters on Visual Wake\nWords.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-08\narXiv paper ID: 2303.04440v2\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2307.04443v1\n```\nStep #9, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2307.04443v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification latency optimization\n```\nStep #10, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification latency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario.

However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #25, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C. Markhorst* , Jan C. Van Gemert, and Osman S. KayhanCV Lab, Delft University of Technology{t.c.markhorst}@tudelft.nlAbstract. In this paper, we jointly combine image classification andimage denoising, aiming to enhance human perception of noisy imagescapturedbyedgedevices,likelow-lightsecuritycameras.Insuchsettings,it is important to retain the ability of humans to verify the automaticclassification decision and thus jointly denoise the image to enhance hu-man perception. Since edge devices have little computational power, weexplicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing a novel architecture thatintegrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a Neural ArchitectureSearch (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to search for theintegrated model while optimizing for a target latency, classification ac-curacy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures outperformour manually designed alternatives in both denoising and classification,offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our approachempowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like med-ical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.Keywords: ImageDenoising \xb7 NeuralArchitectureSearch \xb7 ImageClassification1 IntroductionThe intersection of edge devices, such as security cameras, and deep learninghas sparked an interest in optimizing neural networks for inference time, furtherreferred to as latency. Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net). Both the baseline and reduced DC-Net use thesame classifier (MB2.5-M Suppl. A).

Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1).

Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%. When comparing DC-NAS M to DC-NAS S,--- Page 11 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 11Decoder 4(iii) Integrated3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearDecoder 4Decoder 3Decoder 2Decoder 1(ii) D-NAS3x3 ConvMBConvStage 3Stage 4Stage 5Stage 6Stage 7Stage 81x1 ConvPool + LinearC-NAS(iv) SequentialDecoder 4Decoder 1-4:Up ConvConcatenate Conv x2(i) C-NASEncoder - SearchableEncoder - Manually pickedDecoder - Manually pickedFig. 7:C-NAS and D-NAS architecture.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

With (i)and (g), we observe a better color reconstruction for (i). Moreover, (i) has less artifactsthan (h). Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 6: The influence of altering the Conv operators in the DC-NAS M decoderto MBConv and scaling down the MBConv alternative by reducing the number ofoperators or decoder layers.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing.

This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement.

A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #25, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net). Both the baseline and reduced DC-Net use thesame classifier (MB2.5-M Suppl. A).

Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

Forhigher noise levels, the denoising performance of the Sequential model is worse thanthe Integrated model.decoder is only optimized for denoising, since the optimization of the classifierdoes not influence it anymore. It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1). We report the metrics averaged over all 11noise levels,\u03c3 in [0, 1].L = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LChar (1)Exp 1. Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models. Both the Integratedand Sequential methods trained on the synthetic noise dataset. The integrated modelperforms significantly better in denoising and slightly worse in classification.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive\nnature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational\npower and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification energy efficiency optimization\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Latency-aware Spatial-wise Dynamic Networks\nSummary: Spatial-wise dynamic convolution has become a promising approach to improving\nthe inference efficiency of deep networks. By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LASNet.\nPublication Date: 2022-10-12\narXiv paper ID: 2210.06223v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #25, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classificationto the EdgeThomas C.

Common tasks to optimize for such efficiency are objectclassification and object detection, which unlock automatic recognition. How-ever, in noisy settings, the recognition accuracy might not be perfect and it isimportant to allow the ability to validate the automatic recognition by humaninspection. Thus, in addition to automatic recognition, the perceptual qualityof the processed image is equally significant. In particular, this is relevant forimages containing noise, which can arise from various sources such as low-lightconditions, sensor noise, or other recording conditions. We focus on using anefficient model that can be used on the edge with the aim of enhancing humanperception for validating the recognition output of noisy images.Domains relying on human image perception but challenged by noisy im-ages, like medical imaging [26], surveillance systems [35], and industrial in-arXiv:2409.08943v1  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2024--- Page 2 ---2 T.C. Markhorst et al.(a) (b) (c) (d) Cls: HumanFig. 1:We take a noisy image (a), which can be interpreted as an animal (b) orhuman (c). We denoise and classify the image (a), aiming to improve human perceptionresulting in (d). Note, in a real application (b) and (c) would not be available, whichincreases the difficulty of interpreting the noisy image.Artist: DALL-E-2 [31]spections [11], can benefit from recently proposed denoising Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) [15,48]. As CNNs denoise better than traditional meth-ods[8,14].FastCNN denoisers[13,49]arerequired toaccommodatethe real-timerequirement of the affected domains. However, denoisers are not able to removeall noise, which is not always enough for human image perception.We further improve human understanding of the image by combining de-noising with machine perception, like image classification. From the Human-Computer Cooperation strategies in [41], we use the Classifier as Aid to Human.Where the image classifier can be used as a direct advisor or an independentagent to the security guard, the latter being analogous to a second opinion inmedical diagnosis. In different use cases, fusing skills of humans and computershas been shown to improve performance beyond using only one type [2,24,41].Therefore, we investigate models that can leverage the benefits of both denoisingand classification to enhance human understanding in real time.A model combining both denoising and classification is studied in [21], fo-cusing on denoising performance. In addition, we optimize for efficiency, whichis required for edge devices, and classification. Our efficiency definition is basedon two elements: (i) latency reduction while (ii) retaining denoising performanceand classification accuracy. These elements could be optimized using indepen-dent classification and denoising models. However, we propose an architecturecombining the tasks more efficiently.First, we employ established model design approaches to enhance indepen-dent denoising and classification models, such as model scaling [25,37] and ef-ficient operators [33]. Although the models are optimized, they still operateseparately, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Hence we propose and comparetwo methods that join both tasks, yielding a novel and efficient architecture.Adjusting this architecture for each device and desired latency can be labori-ous and requires expert knowledge. These issues have recently garnered interest,leadingtotheemergenceofnewautomatedarchitecturesearchtechniques,whichhave achieved competitive results in image classification [38,42]. Moreover, re-cent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches incorporate latency in their--- Page 3 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 3loss function, enabling the design of architectures tailored to specific latencyrequirements [16,19,42]. Combining NAS with the proposed architecture pro-vides a seamless and efficient approach to designing denoising and classificationmodels for diverse use cases.We find that our proposed efficiency-focused architecture consistently out-performs our more straightforward one. This is observed for both the manuallyand NAS designed models. In addition, our NAS models significantly outperformthe manually designed ones in denoising and classification performance.We have the following contributions. (i) We introduce a novel architecture toefficiently combine denoising and classification. The novelty lies in sharing an en-coder between the denoiser and the classifier. (ii) We propose modifications to anexisting NAS method for classification [19] to stabilize its search, improving theperformance of the found architectures. (iii) We extend an existing NAS methodto search for a model that combines denoising and classification, optimized fora target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.Since no prior work proposes a joint efficient model for denoising and classi-fication, we study the tasks both separately and joint in Sec. 3. The findings areused as expert knowledge to construct the NAS method in Sec. 4.12 Related workDenoising. Image denoising aims to reconstruct a clean imagex from its ob-served noisy varianty. This relation can be formulated asy = x + n, where weassume n to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Neural network-baseddenoisers offer faster inference and good performance compared to traditionaldenoising methods like BM3D [8] and WNNM [14]. The interest in deep learningfor denoising started with DnCNN [48], a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). Encoder-decoder architectures became popular due to their efficienthierarchical feature extraction. Specifically, UNet [32] whose skip-connectionsbetween the encoder and decoder enhance the denoising process as shown infollow-up methods [15,23,29]. The interest in the UNet structure continues withtransformer architectures [12,39]. In this paper, our denoisers are based on UNet,ensuring our findings can translate to most related work.Efficient classification. Optimization for efficiency is generally achievedby either compressing pre-trained networks [28] or designing small networks di-rectly [33,38]. We focus on efficient design, for which handcrafted models andneural architecture search (NAS) play essential roles. Studies proposing hand-crafted models often introduce efficient operators [17,33,50] or scaling meth-ods [37]. These efficient operators are used in NAS methods [38,42] aiming for theautomated design of efficient neural networks. Such an operator is the invertedresidual with a linear bottleneck (MBConv), as introduced in MobileNetV2 [33].In our models, we study scaling methods and MBConv\u2019s efficiency characteristic.Neural Architecture Search.The use of reinforcement learning (RL) forneural architecture search introduced efficient architectures with competitive1 Project site:https://thomas-markhorst.github.io--- Page 4 ---4 T.C. Markhorst et al.classification performance [16,30,36,38]. However, their discrete search space iscomputationally expensive. Differentiable NAS (DNAS) methods [3,22,42] sig-nificantly reduce this cost by relaxing the search space to be continuous usinglearnable vectors\u03b1 for selecting candidate operations, which allows for gradient-based optimization. The popularity of DNAS started with DARTS [22], whichsearches a cell structure. Due to the complex design and repetitiveness through-out the network of the cell structure, follow-up works [19,42] search operatorsfor every layer instead of constructing repeating cells.Pitfalls of DNAS are the collapse of search into some fixed operations and aperformance drop when converting from the continuous search network to thediscretized inference network [6,45,46]. TF-NAS [19] addresses these issues withan adaptation in the search algorithm, which lets the search model mimic thediscrete behavior of the inference model. In addition, TF-NAS searches an archi-tecture with a target latency by adding a latency loss to the search optimization.Because of these properties, we use TF-NAS as a baseline for our NAS study.Existing NAS methods for denoising are either not reproducible [27], have acell-based search space [47], or do not have an encoder-decoder [5] architecture.Instead, we use a layer-based search space and encoder-decoder structure.Jointclassificationanddenoising. In[43],thepositiveinfluenceofdenois-ing methods on classification performance is discussed. Moreover, [21] proposeda joint model where a VGG classifier [34] is attached to a denoiser similar toUNet.Thismethod[21]reportsaqualitativeimprovementofthedenoisedimageswhen adding the classification loss to the denoiser\u2019s optimization, whereas [43]reports a quantitative improvement. Although these models denoise and classifywell, they are not optimized for efficiency. In this paper, we design a joint imagedenoising and classification method for edge devices.3 Exploiting Expert KnowledgeWe start in a controlled setting with separate baseline models for classificationand denoising. Additionally, methods to increase their respective efficiency arestudied, resulting in a reduced version of the baseline denoiser and classifier.Both the construction and efficiency improvement of the models are describedin Suppl. A, where a UNet (Fig. 2) and simple 2-block CNN (Fig. 2.i and 2.ii)are used as baseline denoiser and classifier respectively. This section describeshow the different sizes of the classifiers and denoisers are used to study joiningmethods and their efficiency.Dataset & settings. For the experiments in this section, we generate acontrolled synthetic data set to study the behavior of the classifier and denoiserwhen applying model scaling, replacing the convolutional operations, and com-bining both models. The dataset consists of 30k images, each with a randomconstant background in a gray tint [0.1 - 0.3] with two randomly placed non-overlapping MNIST [10] digits. We use two digits to increase the complexity ofthe denoising task. For experiments including classification, the two digits areextracted from the image using ground truth locations. These extracted digits--- Page 5 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 5U-Net denoiser (i) Sequentiald=3\u22c5bm\u22c5b(ii) IntegratedEncoderDecoderClassi\ufb01erLinearConvMax poolSkipUpConvorc=2Fig. 2:A UNet, with hyperparameters base feature map width (b), depth (d), channelmultiplier (m) and convolutions per layer (c). For the joint model either attach theclassifier to form (i) the Sequential model or (ii) the Integrated model.are separately used as input for the classifier. In the experiments where noiseis required, for either denoising or noisy classification, synthetic Gaussian noiseis added. This noise is zero mean, and the intensity of the noise is controlledusing the standard deviation (\u03c3) of the distribution. Fig. 3a shows a sample,and Fig. 3b its noisy variant. To test the model behavior on an extensive noiserange, every model is trained and tested on eleven\u03c3 values evenly spaced on theinterval [0, 1] (Tabs. 1, 7 and 8). The models are trained using Adam optimizerwith 1E-3 learning rate (LR), plateau LR scheduler, and 100 epochs.Since the experiments with the controlled data set are not targeted at aspecific device, the metric defining efficiency should not depend on a device.Such a metric is computational power, most commonly defined as Floating PointOperations (FLOPs), which we use as the primary metric. Despite being devicedependent, we assess latency as a secondary metric. The latency is measuredwith a batch size of 32, 100 warm-up inference passes and averaged over 1000inference passes. Classification performance is quantified using accuracy, whilefordenoisingperformancethePeakSignal-to-NoiseRatio(PSNR)andStructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) metrics [40] are used. Higher is better for all our metrics.3.1 Joint model: DC-NetExperimentalsetup. Weconstructabaselineandreducedjointmodel,Denoising-Classifying Network (DC-Net). Both the baseline and reduced DC-Net use thesame classifier (MB2.5-M Suppl. A). Whereas UNet-S and UNet are used for thereduced and baseline DC-Net respectively.Forjoiningthedenoiserandclassifier,weproposetwomodels:(i)aSequentialmodel where the classifier is attached after the denoiser (Fig. 2.i), and (ii) anIntegrated model, the classifier is attached to the UNet encoder (Fig. 2.ii). Forthe Integrated model, classification and denoising branches share the encoder.The benefits of the Integrated model could come in threefold. First, using ashared encoder removes the need for a second large classifier, as in the Sequen-tial method. Second, the decoder and classifier branches could run in parallelcompared to running sequentially, which can result in lower latency. Thirdly, the--- Page 6 ---6 T.C.

It can result in better image quality.The models are trained using a weighted combination of the Cross-Entropyand Charbonnier loss [1,20] (Eq. 1). We report the metrics averaged over all 11noise levels,\u03c3 in [0, 1].L = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LChar (1)Exp 1. Integrated vs. Sequential.Which joining method performs betterfor the baseline, and does the same conclusion hold when reducing its size?We compare theSequential and Integrated models. In Tab. 1, we see that forboth the baseline and reduced DC-Net models, the Integrated version performssignificantly better at denoising, while the Sequential version performs better atclassification. The difference in denoising performance is visualized in Fig. 3. Wesee that both the reduced (3c) and baseline (3e) Integrated models reconstructthe digit clearly. Whereas both sizes of the Sequential model (3d and f) fail toreconstruct the digit.Conclusion. The integrated model has a slightly lower classification accu-racy compared to the Sequential model, yet it has superior performance in termsof image quality. When aiming for improved human perception, it is still requiredfor the human to see the content of the image. Therefore, the Integrated modelis more suitable for joint denoising and classification and is called DC-Net.Table 1:Comparison of the reduced and baseline joint models. Both the Integratedand Sequential methods trained on the synthetic noise dataset. The integrated modelperforms significantly better in denoising and slightly worse in classification.

TF-NAS [19] is used to construct a classifier, which we use as a basis for our denoiserand joint model. All our proposed models in this Section contain searchableblocks, the models and which parts are searchable are defined in Figure 7.Dataset & settings.The following experiments are conducted on Imagenet[9], randomly cropped to 224x224 pixels. To reduce search and training time, 100classes (Imagenet 100) from the original 1000 classes were chosen, as in [19]. Inthe experiments requiring noise, Gaussian noise is sampled uniformly with acontinuous range of\u03c3 in [0, 1] (Tabs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).The models are searched using SGD with momentum, 2E-2 LR with 90epochs. Afterward, the found architecture is trained from scratch with 2E-1 LRfor 250 epochs. All other settings are similar to [19]. The loss function dependson the task of the experiment, Cross-Entropy with label smoothing for classifi-cation (LCE), combined Charbonnier and SSIM losses for denoising (LDen), anda weighted combination for the joint model (LBoth), see Eq. 2, 3.LDen = 0.8 \xb7 LChar + 0.2 \xb7 LSSIM (2)LBoth = 0.1 \xb7 LCE + 0.9 \xb7 LDen (3)Since our NAS method uses a latency look-up table constructed for our de-vice, these experiments target a specific device, GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. There-fore latency is suitable for defining efficiency in the NAS experiments.4.1 Classification: C-NASExperimental Setup.Since TF-NAS [19] learns\u03b2\u2019s to control the number ofconvolutional operators per stage,\u03b2\u2019s can reduce the model size. However, in--- Page 8 ---8 T.C. Markhorst et al.the models proposed by [19], only 2 out of 24 stages are reduced by\u03b2. So the\u03b2\u2019s have little effect on the found architectures, yet they make the search spacemore complex. Therefore, we propose a version of TF-NAS where the\u03b2\u2019s areremoved so that all convolutional blocks are used.The candidate operations in the search space of TF-NAS are MBConvs with8 different configurations, see Suppl. B. The configurations differ in kernel size,expansion rate, and in- or excluding a squeeze- and excitation layer (SE) [18].The classification experiments are performed using data without noise, asthe aim is to examine the NAS method, which is designed for clean images.We investigate key components of TF-NAS and try to improve its stability andclassification performance.Exp 1. Learned vs. Removed\u03b2. We conduct an experiment to study theeffect of removing\u03b2 on the search quality. The SE-layer is excluded from thecandidate blocks, halving the search space to ensure the number of candidateoperations does not cause search instability. We set a low target latency of 6ms, as learning\u03b2 should have a positive effect on small networks. For both thelearned and removed settings, we run two searches, search 1 and 2.Fig. 4 shows that when\u03b2 is learned, the\u03b1\u2019s selecting a candidate operationoscillate and therefore do not decide on an architecture. Whereas with Removed\u03b2, the search is stable. This stability is reflected in the performance, as theaverage accuracy of the Removed\u03b2 models is 86.3%, compared to 84.2% forLearned \u03b2. The separate results for each model are shown in Suppl. C.Exp2.Numberofoperatorsinsearchspace. Doesreducingthenumberof operators during search positively influence the performance of the foundmodels? We test this by comparing the performance of architectures searchedwith three different search space sizes, {4, 6, or 8} operations, defined in Suppl.B. For each of these search spaces, three different latency targets are used: {6,8, and 12} ms.In Fig. 5, we see that for lower target latencies, 6 and 8 ms, using feweroperations in the search space does not alter performance significantly. Whentargeting 12 ms latency, reducing the number of operations in the search spacedoes show a significant improvement. Additionally, we find that when using thelarger search spaces, the operators from the small search space are still preferredfor lower latencies.Exp 3. Compare with original TF-NAS.How do architectures foundusingourproposedchangestoTF-NASperformcomparedtomodelswithsimilarlatency? We compare our model, C-NAS M, with TF-NAS C, MobileNetV2,and ResNet-18. MobileNetV2 our model have similar latency, architecture, andoperator types. ResNet only differs in that it uses the Conv operator. We includethese standard baseline architectures to indicate where C-NAS, see Fig. 7.i,stands on Imagenet100.Fig. 6 shows that the model found using our method has lower latency yethigher accuracy than TF-NAS C as proposed in [19]. The model is searchedwith target latency 8.0. We observe that our search method is able to find amodel that matches its target latency. Although ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2--- Page 9 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 9run faster than our model, our classification accuracy is superior, especially whencompared to ResNet-18, which only uses Convs.Conclusion. By Removing \u03b2 and reducing the number of operators usedin the search, the search stability increases, and we find architectures that havebetter accuracy. An architecture found using our changes classifies better thana TF-NAS architecture with similar latency.The comparison between our model and ResNet-18 shows that our searchspace is able to compete with widely accepted Conv-based classifiers. Moreover,our model performs on par with MobileNetV2, a manually designed classifierusing MBConvs.4.2 Denoising: D-NASExperimental setup.To construct a denoiser, D-NAS (Fig. 7.ii), we use thefirst six stages of a found C-NAS classifier, which has four levels of resolution.Afterwards, we attach a UNet style decoder by using both a transposed convo-lution and two normal convolutions for each decoder level. Like UNet, we alsoadd skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers. The decoder isnot searched.Exp 1. D-NAS vs UNet denoiser.Does our denoiser D-NAS performsimilarly to the UNet denoisers? For this experiment, we use UNet-S (Sec. A.2){d = 4,b = 8,c = 2,m = 1.5}, with a latency of 9.2 ms and the larger UNet-M,{d = 4, b = 16, c = 2, m = 2} with a latency of 16.9 ms. We compare themwith our D-NAS M, with similar latency.Table 2:Comparison of D-NAS and UNet variants for denoising. D-NAS outperformsslightly faster UNet-S, but UNet-M denoises best at the cost of 45% higher latency.Model UNet params:Lat.

However, the 7.7 ms slower UNet variant,UNet-M, denoises better than our proposed model, by 0.3 dB and 1% SSIM.Conclusion. D-NAS performs similarly to our baseline UNets. ThereforeD-NAS is a suitable denoising architecture and it can form the backbone of ourIntegrated model.4.3 Joint Model: DC-NASExperimental setup. To construct the joint model, we use the Integratedsetup. The Integrated model, DC-NAS, is constructed similarly to D-NAS. We--- Page 10 ---10 T.C. Markhorst et al.Table 3:Comparison of DC-NAS models searched for three different latencies, withtheir corresponding C-NAS model, classifier baseline, and denoiser baseline.

The design choicesfor DC-NAS are discussed in the ablations study (Sec. 4.4).Using our search method, we search for DC-NAS models of three differentsizes{S,M,L}.ApartfromourmanuallydesignedIntegratedmodel,wecompareour searched models with separate state-of-the-art classifiers and denoisers, asthere are no existing models that jointly optimize denoising, classification, andefficiency. For each DC-NAS model, we also separately train the classifier (C-NAS) to evaluate the influence of joint denoising. The classifier and denoiserbaselines are chosen to have similar latency as the C-NAS or D-NAS model onwhich the corresponding DC-NAS is based.Results. We discuss the results in Tab. 3 in three separate sections for thedifferent target latencies. Our smallest Integrated model, DC-NAS S, outper-forms both of its classifier baselines MobileNetV3 and C-NAS S. Note, that thelatter shows that the classifier, C-NAS S, performs better when integrated intoDC-NAS S. Moreover, our Integrated model denoises better than its baselineUNet-S (Suppl. A). DC-NAS S also significantly outperforms our manually de-signed DC-Net S (Reduced), which is the only Integrated baseline. We displaythe denoising results of DC-Net, UNet-S, and DC-NAS S in Fig. 8. We observebetter denoising on smooth areas, sharper edges, and more realistic color recon-struction for DC-NAS S.The results of DC-NAS M follow a similar pattern, where our DC-NAS out-performs its baseline denoiser and classifier, using C-NAS M in the Integratedmodel boosts accuracy by 0.5%.

Comparing DC-NAS M\u2019s denoising per-formance to 3.2 ms slower UNet-M we observe slightly worse denoising perfor-mance. However, our Integrated model denoises and classifies with lower latency.For DC-NAS L, we observe that both the classification and denoising baselineslightly outperform our Integrated model. EfficientNetV2-b1 has 0.3% higherclassification accuracy than DC-NAS L, and UNet-M improves with 0.7 dBPSNR and 2% SSIM. However, our Integrated model performs both denoisingand classification at a similar latency as UNet-M, which only denoises. Whencomparing DC-NAS L with DC-NAS M, we again note an improvement in classi-fication performance. However, the PSNR score drops by 0.2 dB while the moreimportant SSIM score remains at 0.70.Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DC-NAS modelsperform similar or better than their denoising and classification baselines fortheir target latency. In addition, the searched model performs better than ourmanually designed joint denoiser and classifier.4.4 Ablation StudyExp 1. Encoder search.C-NAS forms the encoder of DC-NAS and containsthe searchable operations within DC-NAS. We test multiple search approaches:--- Page 12 ---12 T.C. Markhorst et al.(i) using clean images, and (ii) using noisy images. For both approaches, wesearch the encoder using only classification lossLCls. In addition, we also searchthe DC-NAS encoder on noisy images using the combined denoising and classi-fication lossLBoth. Therefore it searches for the optimal encoder for both taskswithin the Integrated model DC-NAS. Regardless of the search method, thefound models are trained using noisy images and the combined loss.Tab. 4, shows that when usingLCls with noisy images during search improvesclassification accuracy by 0.3%. Surprisingly, the denoising performance is thesame. Using both the denoising and classification objectives during the searchreduces the classification accuracy. Caused by the denoising loss complicatingthe search, without improving denoising performance. Therefore, we search ourDC-NAS models by only usingLCls loss.Exp 2. Compare Integrated vs. Sequential.We compare DC-NAS andDC-NASseq models with similar latency. Where DC-NASseq is our Sequentialmodel, which is constructed by attaching C-NAS to the output of D-NAS, seeFig. 7.iv. Since the searched classifier is used twice in DC-NASseq, the Sequen-tial model has a higher latency than the Integrated variant. To counter this, asmaller C-NAS model is used in both the encoder and classifier of DC-NASseq.The classifier, C-NAS, used to construct DC-NASseq L has a latency of 6.7 ms.Whereas in DC-NAS L, the classifier has a latency of 12 ms. Note, that thesemodels were searched by using clean instead of noisy images, as this holds forboth models it is still a fair comparison.We see that both models have similar latency and the same classification ac-curacy, however, DC-NAS L improves denoising performance with 0.5 dB PSNRand 1% SSIM (Tab. 5). This improvement is caused by DC-NAS L\u2019s Integrateddesign as this allows for a bigger encoder without increasing latency.Table 4:Different search strategies for DC-NAS, using (i) clean or noisy images and(ii) LCls or LCls + LDen.

Decoder tuning.The DC-NAS models found in Tab. 3 and 5, havesimilar denoising performance. These models differ only in the type of MBConvsthat are selected during search in the encoder. We test the hypothesis if thedenoising performance is influenced by adjusting the operators in the decoderwhile retaining the latency. DC-NAS M is used as a basis in this experiment. Weconstruct three alternatives. First, the convolutional operators in the decoderare replaced with MBConvs (MB-k3-e3) [33], which significantly increases thelatency of the model. To account for this, we scale down the decoder by (i)--- Page 13 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 13Table 5:Comparing Sequential and Integrated DC-NAS, classification performance issimilar, yet the Integrated model is faster and denoises better.Model Lat.

Hence, DC-NAS S denoises better than the other denoisers of similar latency.using 1 instead of 2 convolutional operations (MBConv) per layer or (ii) using 3instead of 4 decoder layers.In Tab. 6, we see that using the MBConvs compared to Convs improves thedenoising performance. However, at the cost of a 14 ms latency increase, onlycaused by the MBConv decoder. When reducing the complexity of the MBConvdecoder with1 operatorand 3 layers, the denoising performance reduces to theoriginal level again, but the latency is still higher than for DC-NAS M whichhas only standard convolutional layers in the decoder block.Conclusion. We have seen that the Integrated combining method outper-forms its Sequential counterpart in denoising. To construct the integrated model(DC-NAS), we find that searching for a classifier on noisy data, without takingthedenoisingobjectiveintoaccountresultsinthebestclassificationperformance.--- Page 14 ---14 T.C.

However, the NAS denoising experiments demonstrate that our denois-ing setup is competitive. Since tuning the decoder operators does not improveperformance, our method is focused on searching for only the encoder of theintegrated model. The models found by this approach, outperform our manuallydesigned models with similar latency.5 Limitations & ConclusionOne limitation of our NAS method is its inability to alter the decoder. It isdesigned this way as manually altering the decoder does not improve efficiency.However, when targeting a significantly different latency, a change in denoisingarchitecture could be required. Therefore, designing model scaling rules for thesearched models is of interest, similar to the EfficientNets [37,38].Another limitation is the fixation of\u03b2 in our NAS method. Although this im-provesthestabilityofsearchandnetworkperformance,learning \u03b2 whileretaininga stable search would be preferred. This would introduce more possibilities inthe search space for optimizing efficiency.In addition, the latency of Integrated models can be reduced further by run-ning the denoising and classification branches in parallel.To conclude, we show that using efficient operators and scaling methodsproposed in previous work [25,33,37] are relevant for denoising and noisy clas-sification. In addition, we present the Integrated model DC-Net to join the twotasks efficiently and show that the Integrated design is more suitable across var-ious latencies than the Sequential variant. To simplify the design process of thejoint model when targeting a latency, we present a NAS method. We alter anexisting NAS method to improve the stability and performance of the search.This method searches a classifier. Using the searched classifier as a basis, webuild the Integrated DC-NAS model. We demonstrate that the proposed modeloutperforms the manually constructed model. We believe that our study can bea precursor of efficient joint low-level and high-level computer vision tasks.--- Page 15 ---Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge 15References1.

We describe the baseline models and several methods to construct thereduced versions.Overview of the models used in the main paper.UNet-S: {d = 4, b= 8, c = 2, m = 1.5}, which is also called Reduced UNet. UNet-M: {d = 4,b = 16, c = 2, m = 2}. UNet: {d = 5, b = 64, c = 2, m = 2}, which is alsocalled Baseline UNet. MB2.5-M: the classifier described in Section A.1 with anMBConv (expansion rate = 2.5) as second convolutional layer.A.1 Efficient ClassificationExperimental setup.Our baseline classifier (Conv-L) consists of two convolu-tional, one global max pooling, and a linear layer. Each convolutional layer alsohas a group normalization [44], max pooling, and ReLU activation function.To construct the reduced version, we use two methods similar to previousworks [33,37]. In the first method, we replace the second convolutional layer withan MBConv layer. Three expansion rates are used{1, 2.5, 4}: (i) rate 1 is thelowest possible value, (ii) rate 4 matches the number of FLOPs of the baseline,and (iii) rate 2.5 is in the middle of those two. The second reduction methodis to lower the number of filters in the baseline, also called the model width.Using these techniques, models with three different FLOP sizes are constructed,{S, M, L}. We use the following naming scheme, Conv-x and MBe-x, where xrepresents the FLOP size ande is the expansion rate of the MBConv.The models are trained using Cross Entropy loss. We report the accuracyaveraged over all 11 noise levels.Exp. 1: Conv vs MBConv comparison.According to [33], the MBConvlayer should be more efficient than a normal convolutional layer. Therefore, whencomparing the two operators in our network, we expect the version with anMBConv layer to need fewer FLOPs for the same accuracy. In Table 7, the MBmodels with expansion rates 2.5 (MB2.5-M) and 4 (MB4-L) classify better thanthe Conv-L model with fewer FLOPs. However, with an expansion rate of 1(MB1-S), the accuracy drops 7% compared to Conv-L. Therefore, [33]\u2019s theoryalso holds for the noisy classifier, but only for the higher expansion rates.Exp. 2: MBConv width & expansion rate scaling. Since MBConvlayers can be used to improve efficiency, we question how to further reduce theMB model\u2019s FLOP size.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive\nnature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational\npower and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #28, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: ```EXPIRATION 3\n--- Page 1 ---Ef\ufb01cient Feature Compression forEdge-Cloud SystemsZhihao DuanElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.duan90@purdue.eduFengqing ZhuElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.zhu0@purdue.eduAbstract\u2014Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system isan important yet challenging problem.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

By allocating more computation to\nthe most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the\nspatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of\nunnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by\nprevious methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on\nthe multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing\nliterature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation,\nignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by\nscheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between\ntheoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware\nspatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially\nadaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The\nlatency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of\ndynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling\nstrategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both\nthe algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware\nplatforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance\nsegmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the\npractical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average\nlatency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36%\nand 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson\nTX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Real-Time Edge Classification: Optimal Offloading under Token Bucket Constraints\nSummary: To deploy machine learning-based algorithms for real-time applications with\nstrict latency constraints, we consider an edge-computing setting where a\nsubset of inputs are offloaded to the edge for processing by an accurate but\nresource-intensive model, and the rest are processed only by a less-accurate\nmodel on the device itself. Both models have computational costs that match\navailable compute resources, and process inputs with low-latency. But\noffloading incurs network delays, and to manage these delays to meet\napplication deadlines, we use a token bucket to constrain the average rate and\nburst length of transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision\nProcess-based framework to make offload decisions under these constraints,\nbased on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal\nof minimizing a specified error measure for the application. Beyond isolated\ndecisions for individual devices, we also propose approaches to allow multiple\ndevices connected to the same access switch to share their bursting allocation.\nWe evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the\nstandard ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nPublication Date: 2020-10-26\narXiv paper ID: 2010.13737v2\n\nTitle: Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit\nSummary: This paper considers a setting where embedded devices are used to acquire and\nclassify images. Because of limited computing capacity, embedded devices rely\non a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local\nclassification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to\nan edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource\nconstraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such\ntransmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this\noffloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a\nmechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,\nonline offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,\nclassification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper\ndevelops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its\nefficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is\nthe fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including\ncorrelation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is\ncarried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using\nsynthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.\nImplementation of this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn.\nPublication Date: 2022-07-31\narXiv paper ID: 2208.00485v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2210.06223v1\n```\nStep #12, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2210.06223v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification power optimization\n```\nStep #13, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification power optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations.

Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: Deeper and wider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior\nperformance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive\nnature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational\npower and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #28, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Ef\ufb01cient Feature Compression forEdge-Cloud SystemsZhihao DuanElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.duan90@purdue.eduFengqing ZhuElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.zhu0@purdue.eduAbstract\u2014Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system isan important yet challenging problem. In this paper, we considera three way trade-off between bit rate, classi\ufb01cation accuracy,and encoding complexity in an edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cationsystem. Our method includes a new training strategy andan ef\ufb01cient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracyperformance. Our design can also be easily scaled accordingto different computation resources on the edge device, taking astep towards achieving rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.Under various settings, our feature coding system consistentlyoutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.Code is made publicly available 1.Index Terms\u2014Feature compression, Coding for machine vision,Image classi\ufb01cation, Edge-cloud systemI. I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance.

For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers.

To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain.

To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: Deeper and wider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior\nperformance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms).

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #28, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Ef\ufb01cient Feature Compression forEdge-Cloud SystemsZhihao DuanElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.duan90@purdue.eduFengqing ZhuElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.zhu0@purdue.eduAbstract\u2014Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system isan important yet challenging problem.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification dynamic computation optimization\n```.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance. We\npresent a class of computer vision models designed using hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search and customized to run on the Edge TPU, Google's neural\nnetwork hardware accelerator for low-power, edge devices. For the Edge TPU in\nCoral devices, these models enable real-time image classification performance\nwhile achieving accuracy typically seen only with larger, compute-heavy models\nrunning in data centers. On Pixel 4's Edge TPU, these models improve the\naccuracy-latency tradeoff over existing SoTA mobile models.\nPublication Date: 2020-03-05\narXiv paper ID: 2003.02838v1\n\nTitle: Task-Oriented Real-time Visual Inference for IoVT Systems: A Co-design Framework of Neural Networks and Edge Deployment\nSummary: As the volume of image data grows, data-oriented cloud computing in Internet\nof Video Things (IoVT) systems encounters latency issues. Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability. Simulated experiments further confirm its efficacy in\nhigh-accuracy, real-time detection for small objects in IoVT systems.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-29\narXiv paper ID: 2411.00838v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nspiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency\n```\nStep #14, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query spiking neural networks edge image classification power efficiency, here was the response\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques.

Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: Deeper and wider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior\nperformance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #26, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification energy efficiency optimization\n```\nStep #27, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification energy efficiency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms).

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #28, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---Ef\ufb01cient Feature Compression forEdge-Cloud SystemsZhihao DuanElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.duan90@purdue.eduFengqing ZhuElmore Family School of Electrical and Computer EngineeringPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A.zhu0@purdue.eduAbstract\u2014Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system isan important yet challenging problem.

I NTRODUCTIONMobile devices and wearable sensors are essential gatewaysto many autonomous systems. These edge devices are oftendeployed with vision tasks in applications involving robotics,drones, surveillance cameras, and smart home devices. How-ever, due to constraints on the device size and power supply,edge devices cannot support the real-time execution of neuralnetworks-based computer vision methods, which are typicallycomputationally expensive. A common solution is to takeadvantage of the wireless connection to a powerful cloudcomputing resource, forming an edge-cloud system [1], [2]as illustrated in Fig. 1. In such a system, we obtain data (inour context, images) from edge device sensors (cameras) andsend it to the cloud for task execution.Designing practical methods for edge-cloud systems ischallenging from several aspects. First, in most cases wherethe edge-cloud connection is band-limited, we have constraintson the transmission bit rate, requiring the captured images tobe compressed by an encoder on the edge as ef\ufb01ciently as pos-sible. Second, we also have constraints on the computationalcapacity of the edge device, and thus the encoder cannot betoo complex. Finally, for common vision tasks such as theimage classi\ufb01cation, we also desire high accuracy. Taking allthese into consideration, we face a three-way trade-off betweenencoder complexity, bit rate, and vision task accuracy, whichWe term as the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off.1github.com/duanzhiihao/edge-cloud-racEdge device(sender)Cloud computing(receiver)Bits \u201ccat\u201dRateEncoder complexityAccuracyFig. 1: Illustration of an edge-cloud machine vision system,where three objectives are of interest: encoder computationalcomplexity on the edge device, bit rate in transmission, andtask accuracy in the cloud. In this paper, we present a featurecompression method for the edge-cloud image classi\ufb01cation.A straightforward baseline for RAC trade-off is to com-press and transmit images using different codecs. However,image codecs are typically developed for image reconstruction,making them suboptimal for vision task execution. Recently,research focused on feature compression has gained attention,which can be optimized for different vision tasks [1], [3].Another advantage to transmit features rather than images isprivacy protection. By transmitting features, one could skippixel reconstruction on the cloud and thus reduce potentiallyexposing image contents to the attackers [4].Entropic Student [2] is a recently proposed feature com-pression framework that provides promising rate-accuracyperformance. However, it does not take into account theencoder complexity as part of the performance trade-off. Toextend the scope to the three-way RAC trade-off, we proposea \ufb02exible encoder whose complexity can be easily adjustedfor different device capacities. Together with a new trainingstrategy, we achieve better RAC performance compared toprevious methods, including image coding baselines and thestate-of-the-art Entropic Student model.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\u2022 We expand the scope of previous feature compressionsystems to include the RAC trade-off.\u2022 We design a \ufb02exible neural network architecture forfeature coding, which is both ef\ufb01cient and achieves goodclassi\ufb01cation performance.\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of our approach, showing its advantages overprevious methods.arXiv:2211.09897v1  [eess.IV]  17 Nov 2022--- Page 2 ---II. R ELATED WORKA. Image CompressionTraditional image coders . Traditional image codecs typi-cally follow a linear transform coding paradigm, such as block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete wavelettransform (DWT). Representative codecs include JPEG, WebP,and BPG (i.e., HEVC intra [5]). Their encoding complexityvaries depending on different factors such as the choice of theentropy coding algorithms, number of prediction modes, andhow much optimization is done during training. In general,more complex computation devoted at the encoder leads tobetter compression performance.Learned image coders . With the rise of deep learning,learned image coders (LICs) extend the traditional lineartransform coding paradigm to a non-linear fashion, which isachieved by transforming images using neural networks [6].Despite improved compression performance compared to tra-ditional codecs, LICs typically require more computationalresources due to highly parameterized neural network layersand autoregressive entropy models [7].The paradigm of image coding share a common disadvan-tage: they are designed for image reconstruction and may besuboptimal for vision tasks in most edge-cloud settings.B. Feature compressionVarious methods have been proposed to compress andtransmit features rather than images for machine vision.Hand-crafted feature coding. Earlier works have exploredcompressing deep features using hand-crafted algorithms. Choiand Baji \xb4c use a block-based intra and inter coding algorithmfor video feature compression in [8] and a HEVC-based fea-ture compression method for object detection in [9]. Followingtheir works, methods have been proposed for feature compres-sion using pruning [10], quantization [11], and bidirectionalprediction [10].Learned feature compression . Instead of manually de-signed methods, recent work has shifted attention to end-to-end learned feature compression and showed promisingresults. Singh et al. use a fully factorized entropy model toconstrain the entropy of features, which results in improvedrate-accuracy trade-off over previous methods [3]. Dubois etal. show that, given enough computational capacity, featurescan be extremely (around 1,000\xd7) compressed without affect-ing the vision task accuracy [12]. More recently, Matsubaraet al. train vision models with feature compressor jointly andshow state-of-the-art rate-accuracy performance [2].While existing methods mostly focus on improving therate-accuracy performance, their approach lacks scalabilityfor different encoder complexity. In this work, we extendthe scope to rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off byproposing a easily scalable encoder architecture, which can beadapted to edge devices with different computation capacities.III.

In this section, we brie\ufb02y summarize it toprovide the background of our method, and we refer interestedreaders to the original paper [2] for more details.The framework for classi\ufb01cation is shown in Fig. 2. Forsplit computing, a feature encoder is designed to be deployedon the edge device, and a decoder together with a classi\ufb01er areexecuted on the cloud. Speci\ufb01cally, a ResNet-50 [14] classi\ufb01eris adopted for image classi\ufb01cation.Training is done in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, theclassi\ufb01er is initialized using a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed(i.e., no parameter updating), and the encoder and decoder arelearned to compress images and reconstruct desired features.In the second stage, the encoder is \ufb01xed, while the decoderand the classi\ufb01er are trained to optimize the task accuracy.The training loss functions are:Lstage1 = \u03bblR + lMSE,Lstage2 = \u03bblR + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (1)where lR is the bit rate loss estimated by a factorized entropymodel [6], lMSE is the mean squared error (MSE) betweenthe classi\ufb01er\u2019s intermediate features and the ones from a pre-trained teacher model, lKL is the KL divergence loss forknowledge distillation [16], lCE is the standard cross-entropyloss for classi\ufb01cation, and \u03bb is a scalar hyperparameter totrade-off between rate and classi\ufb01cation accuracy.The deployment scenario is shown in Fig. 2b, where theentropy model is shared between the sender (edge) and thereceiver (cloud) for entropy coding, implemented by the range-based asymmetric numeral system (rANS) algorithm [15].Despite its strong rate-accuracy performance [2], the En-tropic Student model only operates at a single encoder com-plexity and is not feasible for RAC trade-off. In the nextsection, we introduce our method, which not only improves therate-accuracy performance, but also enables the RAC trade-off.--- Page 3 ---\u0ddc\U0001d466\u0ddc\U0001d466tLabel \U0001d466Enc.

In (a), we show the training strategy, where the entropy model is fully factorized, andgray blocks indicate frozen models (i.e., no parameter update during training). The classi\ufb01er can either be trained jointly withthe system, or initialized with a pre-trained model and \ufb01xed throughout training. In (b) and (c), we show our encoder anddecoder architecture, respectively. Our encoder network complexity can be tuned by adjusting the number of residual blocks,N. For the classi\ufb01er, we use a truncated version of ResNet-50, following [2].IV. O UR APPROACHInspired by the success of knowledge distillation in the En-tropic Student model, we adopt a similar framework and lossfunctions, shown in Fig. 3a. However, we make modi\ufb01cationsincluding a new training strategy and network architecture, bywhich we are able to realize the RAC trade-off.A. Single-stage TrainingThe Entropic Student method adopts a two-stage trainingstrategy, where the encoder and decoder are trained in the\ufb01rst stage, and the decoder and classi\ufb01er are \ufb01ne-tuned in thesecond stage. We note that this decoupled training strategyrequires more hyperparameter searching, and it is also sub-optimal for rate-accuracy performance since network compo-nents are trained separately. Instead, we propose a simple \ufb01x,i.e., to train the encoder, decoder, and classi\ufb01er in an end-to-end fashion. Our single-stage loss function is as follows:Lsingle = \u03bblR + lMSE + 0.5 \xb7(lKL + lCE), (2)where the terms are de\ufb01ned in Sec. III. We keep the samescaling factor for each loss term as in the Entropic Studentwithout further tuning. Later in Sec. V-D, we show thatour single-stage strategy improves the rate-accuracy trade-offdespite being simpler to implement.B. Network ArchitectureWe introduce an encoder network architecture speci\ufb01callydesigned for ef\ufb01cient and \ufb02exible feature compression, shownin Fig. 3b. We now describe our design choices in details.Downsampling layer. We \ufb01rst noticed that the 5x5 con-volutions for downsampling in previous works (e.g., in theEntropic Student [2] and learned image coders [6], [17]) arecomputationally inef\ufb01cient due to the large overlap betweenconvolutional kernels. To remove this overlap, we adopt asingle patch embedding [18] layer for downsampling, whichcan be equivalently viewed as a convolution with kernel sizeequal to its strides.Network blocks. Instead of feedforward convolutions asin previous works, we adopt residual blocks in our featureencoder, which enables easy adjustment of the encoder com-plexity simply by setting the number of residual blocks, N. Alarger N (i.e., more residual blocks in the encoder) improvesthe rate-accuracy performance while results in higher encodercomplexity. Thus by tuning N, we can trade-off between therate-accuracy performance and the encoding complexity of oursystem. We use a standard design for the residual blocks asshown in Fig. 3c. For non-linearity layers, we use the GeLUactivation [19] instead of GDN [13], as we empirically foundthat the former leads to better performance with the samecomputational complexity.Downsampling ratio. Our \ufb01nal step is to use 8\xd7downsam-pling, instead of the 4\xd7downsampling in Entropic Student,during encoding. Our choice is motivated by the observationthat 8\xd7downsampling is a common choice for various imageprocessing tasks (e.g., in traditional codecs like JPEG) andcomputer vision tasks (e.g., in image object detection [20]and semantic segmentation [21]). Note that in our featuredecoder on the cloud (Fig. 3d), we upsample the feature by2\xd7to recover spatial details of the original image. With thiscon\ufb01guration of the encoder and the decoder, we are able toreduce the encoding latency and improve the average accuracyby a large margin, as discussed later in Sec. V-D.C. Feature Compression for a Fixed Classi\ufb01erSo far, we have considered the joint training setting, wherethe classi\ufb01er and our feature coder are trained jointly. Inaddition, we also examine the setting in which a pre-trainedclassi\ufb01er is available but \ufb01xed, illustrated in Fig. 3a. Thisscenario may happen in practice where there are different edgedevices sharing a single cloud vision model. The edge devicesmay use different feature encoders/decoders according to theircomputational capacity, but the vision model on the cloudshould be \ufb01xed. In this case, we use the same loss functionas in Eq. 2, but we train the encoder and decoder networkswithout updating the classi\ufb01er. We denote the methods in thissetting by cls. \ufb01xed to distinguish them from the joint trainingsetting, where the classi\ufb01er can be trained together with theencoder and the decoder.V. E XPERIMENTSWe compare our method to previous ones for edge-cloudimage classi\ufb01cation. For fair comparison, all methods use theResNet-50 [14] (for image coding methods) or a truncated--- Page 4 ---version of ResNet-50 (for feature coding methods) as theclassi\ufb01er.A. Dataset and MetricsWe use the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset [22] for trainingand testing. Standard data augmentations, including randomresizing and cropping, are applied during training. We use theImageNet val set for testing, in which we resize and center-crop all images such that they have a resolution of 224 \xd7224.All metrics are computed on the 224 \xd7224 val set. Bit rateis measured in terms of bits per pixel (bpp). For classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, we report the top-1 accuracy of the classi\ufb01er predic-tions. For encoding complexity, we focus on the CPU latencysince it well simulates real-world scenarios. All encodinglatencies are measured using an Intel 12700K CPU, averagedover the \ufb01rst 5,000 images in the val set.We also introduce a new metric, Delta-accuracy, whichcomputes the average accuracy improvement (w.r.t. a baselinemethod) over all bit rates. By using this metric, we cansummarize each rate-accuracy curve into a scalar, thus beingable to represent the three-way RAC trade-off in a 2-D plot.Our computation of Delta-accuracy follows the convention ofBD-PSNR and BD-rate [23] except one aspect. Unlike PSNR,the unit of accuracy is percentage (not decibel), so we computeaverage accuracy improvement over the normal bit rate space(instead of the logarithmic rate scale used in BD-PSNR).B. Experiment SettingsWe consider the following baseline methods.Image coding baselines. We compress images using animage codec at the sender side, and we reconstruct images atthe receiver side using the same codec. Then, we run ResNet-50 on the reconstructed images to infer class prediction. Ourselected codecs include handcrafted (e.g., WebP and BPG [5])and learning-based methods (e.g., the Factorized model [6],and the Hyperprior model [17]).Feature coding baseline. We use the existing best method,Entropic Student [2], as a powerful baseline.As we discussed in Sec. IV-C, we group methods into twogroups so that methods within each can be fairly compared.Classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is usedand remains \ufb01xed (i.e., no \ufb01ne-tuning). The image codingbaselines all fall in this setting. We label the methods in thissetting as cls. \ufb01xed.Joint training setting: The pre-trained ResNet-50 is jointlytrained with the feature encoder and/or decoder. The EntropicStudent model falls in this setting. We label the methods inthis setting as joint.C. Main Results for RAC Trade-offTo benchmark our method against the baselines in terms ofRAC performance, we \ufb01rst measure the rate-accuracy curvesfor all baselines and our methods. Then, we compute the Delta-accuracy of each method w.r.t. the Entropic Student baseline(whose Delta-accuracy is 0 by de\ufb01nition). We show the Delta-accuracy as a function of encoding latency in Fig. 4.

The Delta-accuracy is w.r.t. the EntropicStudent baseline.the Entropic Student [2] corresponds to a single point on thecomplexity vs. Delta-accuracy plot since its complexity cannotbe tuned. Similarly, the Factorized model [6] and Hyperpriormodel [17] also produce a single point on the this plot. ForWebP and BPG [5] codec, we control the encoding latency bysetting the compression speed option provided by the codecimplementation. For our method, we control the latency bychoosing N \u2208{0,4,8}, where N is the number of residualblocks in the encoder.From Fig. 4, we observe that for classi\ufb01er \ufb01xed methods,our approach clearly outperforms the image coding baselinesby a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of featurecoding. This improvement is expected, because our featureencoder and decoder are explicitly trained to maximize classi-\ufb01cation accuracy, instead of pixel reconstruction as in imagecoding baselines. For the joint training setting, our methodachieves higher Delta-accuracy than the Entropic Student base-line with approximately only half of the encoding latency. Inaddition, the \ufb02exible design of our encoder enables encodingcomplexity adjustment, as opposed to the Entropic Student, bywhich only a single complexity can be achieved.D. Ablation StudyTo analyze how each component of our method contributesto the RAC improvement, we start from the Entropic Studentbaseline, and we include our proposed components one ata time. At each step, we show the change of rate-accuracyperformance as well as the encoding complexity.We \ufb01rst compare our single-stage strategy (referred to ascon\ufb01guration A) with the original two-stage one in Fig. 5. InTable I, we also show the encoding complexity and Delta-accuracy. We observe that the single-stage training does notimpair the performance; instead, the average accuracy slightlyincreases by 0.13% with encoding complexity unchanged.Then, we replace the Entropic Student encoder by ourpatch embedding layer and residual blocks, and we show the--- Page 5 ---0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2Bits per pixel (bpp)57.560.062.565.067.570.072.575.0T op-1 acc.

Notethat the downsampling ratio ( 4\xd7) is unchanged. We can seethat the improved architecture reduces the encoding latencyby more than 30% and improves the average accuracy by anadditional small percentage ( 0.07%).Finally, we increase the downsampling ratio to 8\xd7 aswe discussed in Sec. IV-B, and we refer to this version ascon\ufb01guration C . By increasing the downsampling ratio, weagain reduce the encoding latency and improve the averageaccuracy by an additional large margin, after which we achievean overall latency reduction of 50% and an average accuracyimprovement of 0.93%. From Fig. 5, we notice that theimprovement is most signi\ufb01cant at lower bit rates. We con-jecture that lower bit rates naturally call for a more compactcompressed representation, which can be achieved by moreaggressive downsampling. For higher bit rate (e.g., more than0.8 bpp), our approach remains on par with the baseline.VI. C ONCLUSIONIn this paper, we present a feature coding system for imageclassi\ufb01cation in edge-cloud systems. We show that by properdesign of the network architecture, existing feature codingmethods can be improved and extended to consider the RACtrade-off. Our system outperforms all previous methods interms of RAC trade-off, which we believe is valuable formany real-world applications deployment. A limitation of oursystem is the requirement of a separate neural network modelfor every rate-complexity pair, which we leave to our futurework to solve.REFERENCES[1] H. Choi and I. V .

We show how our method can outperform\ncompeting approaches on image classification tasks in datasets where color\ninformation matters.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-04\narXiv paper ID: 2205.02938v2\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: An Efficient Pattern Mining Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm with Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)\nSummary: Automation of feature analysis in the dynamic image frame dataset deals with\ncomplexity of intensity mapping with normal and abnormal class. The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

Our method includes a new training strategy and an\nefficient encoder architecture to improve the rate-accuracy performance. Our\ndesign can also be easily scaled according to different computation resources\non the edge device, taking a step towards achieving a rate-accuracy-complexity\n(RAC) trade-off. Under various settings, our feature coding system consistently\noutperforms previous methods in terms of the RAC performance.\nPublication Date: 2022-11-17\narXiv paper ID: 2211.09897v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification adaptive inference optimization\n```\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCurrent Step #31, Phase: literature review\n\n[Objective] Your goal is to perform research on the following topic: The goal is to design and evaluate a new technique for optimizing deep learning models for real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing inference latency and power consumption.\nFeedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification adaptive inference optimization, here was the response\nTitle: I-SplitEE: Image classification in Split Computing DNNs with Early Exits\nSummary: The recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) stem from their\nexceptional performance across various domains. However, their inherent large\nsize hinders deploying these networks on resource-constrained devices like\nedge, mobile, and IoT platforms. Strategies have emerged, from partial cloud\ncomputation offloading (split computing) to integrating early exits within DNN\nlayers. Our work presents an innovative unified approach merging early exits\nand split computing. We determine the 'splitting layer', the optimal depth in\nthe DNN for edge device computations, and whether to infer on edge device or be\noffloaded to the cloud for inference considering accuracy, computational\nefficiency, and communication costs. Also, Image classification faces diverse\nenvironmental distortions, influenced by factors like time of day, lighting,\nand weather. To adapt to these distortions, we introduce I-SplitEE, an online\nunsupervised algorithm ideal for scenarios lacking ground truths and with\nsequential data. Experimental validation using Caltech-256 and Cifar-10\ndatasets subjected to varied distortions showcases I-SplitEE's ability to\nreduce costs by a minimum of 55% with marginal performance degradation of at\nmost 5%.\nPublication Date: 2024-01-19\narXiv paper ID: 2401.10541v1\n\nTitle: Task-Oriented Real-time Visual Inference for IoVT Systems: A Co-design Framework of Neural Networks and Edge Deployment\nSummary: As the volume of image data grows, data-oriented cloud computing in Internet\nof Video Things (IoVT) systems encounters latency issues. Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

Data transmissions from devices to\nservers are often over local wireless networks whose bandwidth is not just\nlimited but, more importantly, variable. Furthermore, in cyber-physical systems\ninteracting with the physical environment, image offloading is also commonly\nsubject to timing constraints. It is, therefore, important to develop an\nadaptive approach that maximizes the inference performance of ML applications\nunder timing constraints and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In this\npaper, we use image classification as our target application and propose\nprogressive neural compression (PNC) as an efficient solution to this problem.\nAlthough neural compression has been used to compress images for different ML\napplications, existing solutions often produce fixed-size outputs that are\nunsuitable for timing-constrained offloading over variable bandwidth. To\naddress this limitation, we train a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that\noptimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a\ncompression solution that produces features ordered according to their\nimportance to inference performance. Features are then transmitted in that\norder based on available bandwidth, with classification ultimately performed\nusing the (sub)set of features received by the deadline. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of PNC over state-of-the-art neural compression approaches and\ntraditional compression methods on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an\nedge server connected over a wireless network with varying bandwidth.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-08\narXiv paper ID: 2310.05306v1\n\nTitle: Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies\nSummary: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and\npromising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as\nsequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their\nhigh computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges\nfor deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\nlimitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and\nhardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review\nthat systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in\naccuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains\nlacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy,\nefficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging\nresearch directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit\n(ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire\nfurther research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient\ndeployment on edge devices.\nPublication Date: 2025-02-26\narXiv paper ID: 2503.02891v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification adaptive inference optimization\n```.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: Accelerator-aware Neural Network Design using AutoML\nSummary: While neural network hardware accelerators provide a substantial amount of\nraw compute throughput, the models deployed on them must be co-designed for the\nunderlying hardware architecture to obtain the optimal system performance.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes.

Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively.

This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions.

The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #26, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification energy efficiency optimization\n```\nStep #27, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification energy efficiency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive\nnature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational\npower and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #29, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification dynamic computation optimization\n```\nStep #30, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification dynamic computation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification\nSummary: In classification tasks, it is crucial to meaningfully exploit the\ninformation contained in data.

The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models.

Data transmissions from devices to\nservers are often over local wireless networks whose bandwidth is not just\nlimited but, more importantly, variable. Furthermore, in cyber-physical systems\ninteracting with the physical environment, image offloading is also commonly\nsubject to timing constraints. It is, therefore, important to develop an\nadaptive approach that maximizes the inference performance of ML applications\nunder timing constraints and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In this\npaper, we use image classification as our target application and propose\nprogressive neural compression (PNC) as an efficient solution to this problem.\nAlthough neural compression has been used to compress images for different ML\napplications, existing solutions often produce fixed-size outputs that are\nunsuitable for timing-constrained offloading over variable bandwidth. To\naddress this limitation, we train a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that\noptimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a\ncompression solution that produces features ordered according to their\nimportance to inference performance. Features are then transmitted in that\norder based on available bandwidth, with classification ultimately performed\nusing the (sub)set of features received by the deadline. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of PNC over state-of-the-art neural compression approaches and\ntraditional compression methods on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an\nedge server connected over a wireless network with varying bandwidth.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-08\narXiv paper ID: 2310.05306v1\n\nTitle: Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies\nSummary: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and\npromising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as\nsequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their\nhigh computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges\nfor deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\nlimitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and\nhardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review\nthat systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in\naccuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains\nlacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy,\nefficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging\nresearch directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit\n(ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices.

I NTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)has undergone substantial expansion, leading to remarkableperformance achievements [1], especially for computer visiontasks such as image classification [2]. This increased scalehas increased computational demands, rendering their deploy-ment on resource-constrained platforms like mobile and edgedevices. To mitigate the computational challenges associatedwith deploying DNNs on these devices, various strategieshave been introduced. These include approaches like SplitComputing, Early Exits, and offloading to cloud [3].Split Computing. Edge devices, often constrained by limitedprocessing capabilities, can opt to offload their data to thecloud, which boasts superior computational power. This ap-proach involves running the full-fledged Deep Neural Network(DNN) in the cloud, subsequently returning the inferencesto the edge device. However, this offloading of data to thecloud incurs latency due to communication delays between theedge device and the cloud. To harness the combined resourcesavailable on both mobile devices and the cloud, a strategyknown as \u201dsplit computing\u201d has been introduced. In splitcomputing, the DNN is bifurcated into two segments: a subsetof initial layers is deployed on the edge device, while theremaining layers are hosted in the cloud. The portion deployedon the edge device serves as an encoder for processinginput images, reducing their size and, consequently, mitigatinglatency costs. This hybrid approach facilitates edge-cloud co-inference. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that in splitcomputing, all samples still need to be inferred at the finallayer on the cloud, which, while reducing the computationalburden on edge devices, maintains significant communicationcosts, as every sample is offloaded [3].Early Exits (EE-DNNs). Several previous methods, includingBranchyNet [4], SPINN [5], and LGViT [6], enable the clas-sification of input images by adding classifiers at intermediatelayers within DNNs. In these early exit DNNs, the decisionto classify the image at an intermediate stage is contingenton the confidence of the prediction surpassing a predefinedthreshold. Exiting the network at its early layers demandsless computational resources but may lead to less precisepredictions. Conversely, deeper exits offer greater precisionbut at the cost of higher computational demands. Therefore,determining the best exit point within the network is importantto model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.In our approach, we introduce a hybrid strategy that com-bines both split computing and early exits to optimize resourceusage on both edge devices and the cloud. We define the\u201dsplitting layer\u201d as the final layer on the edge device. At thislayer, we attach an exit point for making inferences locallyon the edge device. Before an input image is transferred tothe cloud, it undergoes classification on the edge device. Ifthe prediction confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold,the process is terminated, and the image is classified on theedge. In cases where the confidence falls below the threshold,the image is offloaded to the cloud for further processing.While previous methods [7], [8] traditionally employ a fixedsplitting layer on the edge device, our approach advocates forthe adaptive selection of the splitting layer. This adaptability isparticularly crucial in real-world scenarios where input imagesoften exhibit various distortions [9]. For instance, edge devicesfrequently encounter noisy or blurred images, with differentlevels of distortion. Pacheco et al. [10] empirically illustratethe influence of noise on confidence values in images. Thedistortion in images changes the latent distribution of thedataset and significantly impacts the confidence values andinference results [7]. During inference, the data arrives in anonline (sequential order) fashion and the ground truth valuesfor the image sample are not available. Hence the questionthen arises, how to adaptively choose the optimal splittinglayer to model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off when theunderlying latent distribution of incoming data changes?To address the challenge of selecting an optimal split-arXiv:2401.10541v1  [cs.LG]  19 Jan 2024--- Page 2 ---L1 L2b1LibjLNEdge Device OffloadFig. 1. Split computing combined with early exits, where the DNN is splitinto two parts with an additional advantage of inference on mobile device.ting layer when the test data has a different distribution ascompared to the dataset used for training, we introduce anonline learning algorithm called I-SplitEE. This algorithmleverages the Multi-Armed Bandit framework [11], utilizingthe confidence in prediction as a surrogate for predictionaccuracy at the exit point. The computational cost is the costof running the DNN on edge devices, while the offloadingcost is the cost of communication delays between edge andcloud. The primary objective is to maximize prediction con-fidence while minimizing computational and offloading costs.I-SplitEE dynamically determines the optimal splitting layerfor an incoming sample based on past observations from thedataset with a given latent data distribution. I-SplitEE modelcould be adapted to different edge devices and communicationnetworks as well using user-specific inputs.For our backbone model, we adopt the lightweight Mo-bileNet V2 [12] model. This choice is an ideal testbed forour algorithm, given its efficiency and competitive accuracycompared to state-of-the-art models. We conduct experimentsunder varying levels of noise (distortion) in the dataset, asdetailed in Section V. Our experimental results on Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets demonstrate that the optimalsplitting layer differs as there are changes in the distributionof data. Specifically, I-SplitEE achieves a significant reductionin the cost (> 55%) with only a minimal drop in performance(\u2264 5%) when compared to the scenario where all samples areprocessed at the final layer.Our key contributions encompass: 1) We integrate splitcomputing and early exiting to enable early inferences for\u201deasy\u201d samples on edge devices. 2) We develop an onlinelearning algorithm I-SplitEE to dynamically select the optimalsplitting layer based on context in an online and unsupervisedmanner. 3) I-SplitEE optimizes the resource utilization acrossedge devices and the cloud. 4) We experimentally validatethat I-SplitEE minimizes performance degradation while sig-nificantly reducing costs compared to the final exit scenario.II. R ELATED WORKSIn this section, we discuss the previous works on Splitcomputing and Early Exit to use DNNs on mobile devices.Split computing for DNNs. Neurosurgeon, as introduced in[15], explores strategies for optimizing the splitting of DNNsbased on the cost considerations associated with selectinga specific splitting layer. In a similar vein, BottleNet [16]incorporates a bottleneck mechanism within split computing.This approach entails deploying a segment of the DNN onan edge device to encode the input sample into a morecompact representation before transmitting it to the cloud forfurther processing. Various training methodologies have beenproposed for training the encoder situated on the edge device.Notably, BottleNet++ employs cross-entropy-based trainingapproaches in the context of split computing.Early-Exit DNNs. Early-exit DNNs have found applicationsacross diverse tasks. In the context of image classification,BranchyNet [4] and several preceding studies utilize clas-sification entropy metrics at different intermediate layers todetermine whether early inference can be made with sufficientconfidence. Approaches like SPINN [5] incorporate earlyexits into DNN architectures, primarily aimed at handlingservice disruptions. Beyond image classification, early exitshave found relevance in various domains, spanning naturallanguage processing tasks (NLP) [17], [18].DNNs on mobile device. AdaEE [7] employs a combina-tion of early-exit DNNs and DNN partitioning to facilitateoffloading data from mobile devices using early-exit DNNs.LEE (Learning Early Exit) [19], DEE (Dynamic Early exit)[20] and UEE-UCB (Unsupervised early exits using UpperConfidence Bound) [21] leverage the multi-armed banditframework to determine optimal exit points. However, theylack the offloading and primarily focus on performing opera-tions on edge devices. LEE and DEE are specifically designedfor efficient edge device inference, particularly in cases ofservice disruptions, employing utility functions that requireaccess to ground-truth labels. Notably, UEE-UCB specializesin learning the optimal exit strategy for the ElasticBERT [18]backbone, primarily tailored for text classification tasks.Our approach distinguishes itself from prior methods inseveral key aspects. 1) We consider not only accuracy but alsocomputational and communication costs when determining theoptimal splitting layer. 2) Our method operates in an onlineand unsupervised setup, offering a novel perspective. 3) Weleverage contextual information, such as confidence scores,to dynamically determine the splitting layer for each sampleduring edge device processing.III. P ROBLEM SETUPIn our scenario, we train a deep neural network (DNN)consisting of L layers. We introduce exit points into thisbackbone after specific layers. We denote the set of layers as[L] = {1, 2, . . . , L}. The set of target classes for classificationis denoted as C. For a given image, x, and an exit attachedto layer i, we define \u02c6Pi(c) as the estimated probability that xbelongs to class c, where c belongs to C. The confidence in theestimated probability class, defined as Ci = maxc\u2208C \u02c6Pi(c), isthe maximum among these estimated probabilities.The DNN processes the image x, and the point at whichthe DNN splits can occur at any layer i where exit is attached,where the layers 1 through i reside on the edge device, andthe remaining layers i + 1 through L are processed on the--- Page 3 ---cloud. In our setup, each image requires two-stage decisions:1) Determining the optimal splitting point in the DNN, and2) Deciding whether to exit at the chosen splitting layer oroffload the task. Notably, the choice of the splitting layer relieson the collective context rather than individual samples. Thechoice to exit or offload depends on individual samples andfollows this process: When the DNN splits at the ith layer, wecalculate Ci(x) and compare it with a predefined threshold,denoted as \u03b1. If the confidence Ci(x) \u2265 \u03b1, the image sampleis inferred locally on the edge device and does not requireoffloading. Otherwise, it is offloaded to the cloud for inferenceat the final layer incurring communication costs.The cost of using the DNN up to layer i encompasses thecomputational cost of processing the image sample up to thatlayer on the edge and performing inference. We represent thecomputational cost associated with splitting at the ith layer as\u03b3i, where \u03b3i is proportional to the layer depth i. Additionally,we introduce the cost of offloading from the edge deviceto the cloud, denoted as o, which depends on factors liketransmission type (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi). We define thereward function for splitting at layer i \u2208 [L] asr(i) = Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i if Ci \u2265 \u03b1 or i = LCL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o) otherwise, (1)where \xb5 serves as a conversion factor, enabling us to representthe cost in terms of confidence. The user-defined value of \xb5reflects the user\u2019s preference and captures the balance betweenaccuracy and cost.The reward function\u2019s interpretation is as follows: when theDNN generates a confident prediction at the splitting layer,the reward is calculated as the confidence at the splittinglayer minus the cost associated with processing the sampleup to the ith layer and performing inference. In the eventof lower confidence, the sample is offloaded to the cloud,incurring offloading costs and inferring at the final layer,with the confidence of CL. If i is equal to L, the sampleis processed entirely on the edge device, eliminating the needfor offloading. For any splitting layer i \u2208 [L], the expectedreward can be expressed asE[r(i)] = E[Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i|Ci \u2265 \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci \u2265 \u03b1]+ E[CL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o)|Ci < \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci < \u03b1] (2)and for the last layer L, it is a constant given as E(r(L)) =CL \u2212 \xb5\u03b3L. The goal is to find the optimal splitting layer i\u2217defined as i\u2217 = arg maxi\u2208[L] E[r(i)].Recall (section I) that the problem of choosing optimalthresholds is in an online and unsupervised setup. In thecontext of online learning problems, the Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) [11] setup plays a pivotal role in addressing challengesrelated to dynamic decision-making. Hence, we employ anMAB framework to find the optimal splitting layer based onuser-specific arguments. In this framework, we establish ouraction set as the set of layer indices where exits are attachedin the DNN denoted as E, where each choice corresponds tosplitting the DNN at an exit point. In MAB terminology, thesechoices are referred to as \u201darms.\u201d Within this framework, wedevise a policy denoted as \u03c0 that selects arm it at each timestep t based on prior observations. We define the cumulativeregret of policy \u03c0 over T rounds asR(\u03c0, T) =TXt=1E[r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(it)] (3)where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in thearm selection caused by previous samples. A policy \u03c0\u2217 is saidto be sub-linear if the average cumulative regret vanishes, i.e.R(\u03c0\u2217, T)/T \u2192 0.IV. A LGORITHMIn this section, we develop an algorithm named I-SplitEE.The algorithm is based on the \u2019optimism in the face of un-certainty principle\u2019 and utilizes the upper confidence bounds.Algorithm 1 I-SplitEE1: Input: \u03b1 (threshold), \u03b2\u2265 1, E, \u03b3i \u2200i \u2208 E, o2: Initialize: Q(i) \u2190 0, N(i) \u2190 0.3: Initialize by playing each arm once.4: for t = |E| + 1, |E| + 2, . . .do5: Observe an instance xt6: it \u2190 arg maxi\u2208EQ(i) + \u03b2qln(t)N(i)7: Pass xt till layer it, use threshold \u03b1 and observe Cit8: if Cit \u2265 \u03b1 then9: Infer at layer it and exit10: rt(it) \u2190 Cit (xt) \u2212 \xb5\u03b3it , Nt(it) \u2190 Nt\u22121(it) + 111: Qt(it) \u2190 Ptj=1 rj(k)1 {k=it}/Nt(it)12: else13: Offload to the last layer.

The pseudo-code ofthe algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The working of thealgorithm could be explained as follows: It plays each armonce to obtain rewards Q(i) and counters N(i) for each layerwith an attached exit. After observing each arm once, it playsan arm it that maximizes the UCB index (line 6) in succeedingrounds. UCB index comprises the weighted sum of empiricalaverages of rewards Q(i) and the confidence bonuses. Thesample is then processed till the splitting layer it and if theconfidence is above the threshold \u03b1, the sample exits theDNN; else the sample is offloaded to the cloud with additionalcost o.From the analysis of UCB1 [22], one can easily verify thatI-SplitEE achieves a sub-linear regret. The observed regret isOPi\u2208A\\i\u2217log(n)\u2206iwhere \u2206i = r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(i).--- Page 4 ---0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost (x100)Cost over Pristine (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 0.5 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 1 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 2 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 3 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEEFig. 2.

E XPERIMENTSIn this section, we provide all the experimental details ofthe paper. There are two key phases in our experimentalsetup. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SplitEE-5DE5/README.md.1) Training the backbone: To evaluate I-SplitEE, wetrain the MobileNet V2 model with 6 task-specific exits atintermediate points and the final exit. The placement of exitsis strategically chosen as described in some previous works[7], [23]. The dataset used for training is the Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets. We closely follow the trainingprocedure as described in the paper [7], [19]. The Caltech-256dataset contains undistorted images of objects such as bikes,bears, camels etc. The dataset has a total of 257 differentclasses. The Cifar-10 dataset consists of 10 classes and alsohas a classification task. For the training of the backbone, wesplit the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation andremaining as the test set. Note that after this step no traininghappens. Except in table II, all the given results are from theCaltech-256 dataset due to space constraints.2) Unsupervised learning of Splitting layer based onunderlying distribution: The change in distribution can bedefined by multiple environmental effects, however, we focuson the change as image distortion. Following the training ofthe DNN with attached exits, we apply Gaussian noise asimage distortion on each image from the test set. Gaussiannoise occurs when the camera goes out of focus or the imageis from a foggy environment. To make an image noisy, weadd Gaussian noise to an image with zero mean and standarddeviation \u03c3 to an undistorted image. More standard deviationadds more noise to an image. We vary the standard deviationas \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}.After adding the noise to the image we employ I-SplitEEto find the optimal splitting layer based on the change indistortion present in the image. The predefined threshold islearned on the validation set of the model and is set to 0.6 forCaltech and 0.9 for Cifar-10 as learned by the model. We alsohave two types of costs: 1) Computational cost: As explainedin section III, the computational cost is directly proportionalto the number of layers being processed on the edge device i.e.\u03b3i = \u03bbi where \u03bb is the computational cost for a single layer.\u03bb is user-defined and depends on the processing power ofthe user\u2019s device. We experimented with different processingcost values but due to space constraints, the results are notprovided. However, we set \u03bb = 0 .1 thus normalizing thecost for direct comparison. 2) Offloading cost is also user-defined and depends on the communication network used (e.g.3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi). Hence, we experiment with differentoffloading costs from the set o \u2208 {0.2, 0.4, . . . ,1.0} and show(see subsection V-C) that I-SplitEE gets better results fromother baselines making it robust to different communicationnetworks. For the main results in table I, we fix the offloadingcost as o = 1.0 which is the worst-case scenario. More detailson how to compute the offloading cost can be found in [24].We run all the experiments 10 times and average theresults. The action set is the set of attached exits A ={3, 6, . . .18, 20}. We set the trade-off factor \xb5 = 1 whichcould be varied based on the user\u2019s preferences for accuracyand cost. Smaller values of \xb5 will provide accurate resultsbut with higher costs and vice versa. All the experiments areperformed on a single NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. The trainingrequires \u223c 10 hours of GPU runtime for Caltech-256 and \u223c 7hours for Cifar-10 with all the exits. Learning of the optimalsplitting layer could be executed quickly using the CPU.--- Page 5 ---TABLE IIN THIS TABLE , WE PROVIDE THE % REDUCTION IN COST AS WELL AS ACCURACY WITH DIFFERENT DISTORTION LEVELS \u03c3 ON CALTECH -256 DATASET.Model/Distortion \u03c3 = 0.0 \u03c3 = 0.5 \u03c3 = 1 \u03c3 = 1.5 \u03c3 = 2 \u03c3 = 3Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc CostFinal layer 78.5 100 75.2 100 71.6 100 69.8 100 67.8 100 64.1 100Random exit -4.1 -33.5% -3.4 -20.1% -5.1 -39.7% -7.2 -41.3% -6.2 -37.8% -9.5 -43.9%AdaEE -3.3 -45.8% -4.2 -47.1% -4.6 -47.4% -5.8 -49.7% -5.7 -53.0% -5.2 -50.2%Early-Exit -5.3 -39.2% -9.1 -38.5% -9.9 -38.5% -10.5 -38.8% -10.1 -38.4% -10.8 -37.8%I-SplitEE -2.0 -66.3% -2.1 -65.9% -3.9 -66.7% -5.0 -67.4% -4.8 -66.4% -4.7 -65.7%A. Baselines1) Final-layer: We form this as our main baseline as itis similar to the MobileNet\u2019s inference. However, added exitsmight marginally deteriorate the performance.2) Random exit: We randomly choose a splitting layer andthen exploit that layer for the complete dataset. We choosethe random splitting layer for 10 times and then average theresults provided in table I.3) AdaEE: fixes the splitting layer and then adaptivelychooses the threshold as given in the paper [7]. There isan option to offload but the splitting layer is fixed. All thehyperparameters were kept the same as in the paper.4) Early-Exit: is similar to the classic early exiting setupwhere all the samples are inferred at the edge device and basedon the confidence values being above a given threshold. Thesample passes through the backbone until it obtains sufficientconfidence.B. Impact of change in distortionTo gain a deeper understanding of the influence of im-age distortion, we conducted an analysis of the confi-dence values associated with the final layer of our model.Pristine= 0.0noise= 0.5noise= 1noise= 1.5noise= 2noise= 2.5noise= 3Distortion0.20.40.60.81.0ConfidenceFig. 4. Effect of added noise on confidence.These confidence values are the final layer.As depicted inFigure 4, wepresent boxplotsthat showcasethe confidencevalues at the finallayer, consideringvarious levels ofimage distortion,as well asundistortedimages. The visualrepresentation inthis figure servesas a compellingillustration of the significant impact that image distortionexerts on the model\u2019s confidence. There is a loss in confidenceas the distortion in images increases and might affect themodel if a fixed splitting layer is used. This observationcompels us to adaptively choose the splitting layer as witha change in the underlying distribution of the dataset thedistribution of confidence values also changes at differentexits including the final exit.TABLE IISIMILAR RESULTS AS IN TABLE I FOR CIFAR -10.

Analysis over different overheadsGiven that the offloading cost is a user-defined parameter,we conducted a comprehensive analysis by varying this costwithin the set of values {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} in figure 2.This exploration focused on examining the behaviour of bothaccuracy and cost under different offloading cost scenarios.As the offloading cost increases, it is unsurprising that theoverall cost also rises. Notably, this increase in the offloadingcost does not result in a significant impact on accuracy. Thisobservation suggests the robustness of I-SplitEE to variationsin offloading cost, ensuring that accuracy remains relativelystable. However, we observe that the choice of the optimalsplitting layer adjusts with shifts in the offloading cost. Whenthe offloading cost is elevated, I-SplitEE opts for a deepersplitting layer, aligning with expectations, as the computa-tional cost becomes relatively smaller compared to the offload-ing cost. Consequently, the algorithm\u2019s design prompts thesample to be locally inferred on the edge device. Remarkably,this decision does not compromise the accuracy of the model,due to offloading of samples with low confidence on the edgedevice. As a result, every prediction maintains a high level ofconfidence, resulting in only a marginal reduction in accuracy.Moreover, our analysis reveals that even from a cost per-spective, our model outperforms the early-exit baseline. Thisfinding strengthens the claims regarding the efficacy of I-SplitEE and its ability to strike a compelling balance betweenaccuracy and cost.VI. R ESULTSIn Table I, II, we present the significant outcomes of I-SplitEE, providing insights into accuracy and cost metricsfor images exhibiting varying levels of distortion. Notably,our proposed method, I-SplitEE, demonstrates its remark-able performance by yielding the smallest performance drop(\u2264 5%) and the most substantial cost reduction ( > 65%) incomparison to the final exit. The cost values in the table are--- Page 6 ---computed as the cumulative sum of both computational andoffloading costs over the entire dataset. It is worth notingthat both the \u201dFinal Layer\u201d and \u201dEarly Exit\u201d baselines entailexecuting all computations on the mobile device, resulting ina significant computational cost that impacts the efficiency ofthe edge device. The accuracy loss observed in the \u201dEarlyExit\u201d scenario primarily stems from misclassifications madeby intermediate classifiers, which are subsequently rectifiedin the deeper layers. On the other hand, both \u201dRandom Exit\u201dand \u201dAdaEE\u201d provide an option to offload, but they havefixed splitting layers, preventing dynamic adaptation of thesplitting point. \u201dAdaEE,\u201d however, possesses the advantageof adjusting thresholds based on contextual information.Comparing our method with other baselines, I-SplitEEshowcases a remarkable reduction in cost by efficiently opti-mizing resource utilization on both edge and cloud platforms.The distinct advantage of I-SplitEE lies in its adaptive nature,enabling it to select the optimal splitting layer based on pastsamples. It accounts for a minimal reduction in accuracydue to offloading to the cloud. Overall, I-SplitEE effectivelyoptimizes resource utilization across both mobile devices andcloud infrastructure by balancing the computational as wellas communication costs.VII. C ONCLUSIONWe address the problem of executing the DNNs on edgedevices by considering the resources available on the edge.We propose a method that combines early exits and splitcomputing to reduce the computational cost of inference onedge devices as well as communication costs to the cloud.The developed algorithm I-SplitEE splits the DNN based onthe resources available where the initial part of the DNN isdeployed on the edge device with an exit attached at thelast layer on the edge device. If the sample gains sufficientconfidence on the edge device, it is inferred locally, else itis offloaded to the cloud for inference on the final layer ofDNN. I-SplitEE adapts to changes in the distribution of thetest data when it data arrives in an online and unsupervised.Notably, I-SplitEE has a minimal drop in accuracy even whencost changes making it more robust to different user-specificdevices.Our work could be extended by simultaneously adaptingto the optimal threshold as well as the splitting layer. Also,our method finds the optimal splitting layer based on all thesamples, however, the splitting layer could be learned basedon the difficulty level of the individual samples.REFERENCES[1] K.

We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: An Adaptive Sampling and Edge Detection Approach for Encoding Static Images for Spiking Neural Networks\nSummary: Current state-of-the-art methods of image classification using convolutional\nneural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.\nThis places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that\ncan employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nTitle: A Comprehensive Review of Spiking Neural Networks: Interpretation, Optimization, Efficiency, and Best Practices\nSummary: Biological neural networks continue to inspire breakthroughs in neural\nnetwork performance. And yet, one key area of neural computation that has been\nunder-appreciated and under-investigated is biologically plausible,\nenergy-efficient spiking neural networks, whose potential is especially\nattractive for low-power, mobile, or otherwise hardware-constrained settings.\nWe present a literature review of recent developments in the interpretation,\noptimization, efficiency, and accuracy of spiking neural networks. Key\ncontributions include identification, discussion, and comparison of\ncutting-edge methods in spiking neural network optimization, energy-efficiency,\nand evaluation, starting from first principles so as to be accessible to new\npractitioners.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-19\narXiv paper ID: 2303.10780v2\n\nTitle: Spikemax: Spike-based Loss Methods for Classification\nSummary: Spiking Neural Networks~(SNNs) are a promising research paradigm for low\npower edge-based computing. Recent works in SNN backpropagation has enabled\ntraining of SNNs for practical tasks. However, since spikes are binary events\nin time, standard loss formulations are not directly compatible with spike\noutput. As a result, current works are limited to using mean-squared loss of\nspike count. In this paper, we formulate the output probability interpretation\nfrom the spike count measure and introduce spike-based negative log-likelihood\nmeasure which are more suited for classification tasks especially in terms of\nthe energy efficiency and inference latency. We compare our loss measures with\nother existing alternatives and evaluate using classification performances on\nthree neuromorphic benchmark datasets: NMNIST, DVS Gesture and N-TIDIGITS18. In\naddition, we demonstrate state of the art performances on these datasets,\nachieving faster inference speed and less energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-19\narXiv paper ID: 2205.09845v1\n\nTitle: Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Faster Residual Multi-branch Spiking Neural Network\nSummary: Convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in Hyperspectral Image (HSI)\nclassification tasks, but its high energy consumption and complex network\nstructure make it difficult to directly apply it to edge computing devices. At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2110.10217v1\n```\nStep #16, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2110.10217v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification model compression\n```\nStep #17, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification model compression, here was the response\nTitle: Edge AI: Evaluation of Model Compression Techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: This work evaluates the compression techniques on ConvNeXt models in image\nclassification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The\ncombination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances\ncompression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with\nnumber of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy.

In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches.

This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario.

However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #26, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification energy efficiency optimization\n```\nStep #27, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification energy efficiency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems.

This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #29, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification dynamic computation optimization\n```\nStep #30, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification dynamic computation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification\nSummary: In classification tasks, it is crucial to meaningfully exploit the\ninformation contained in data. While much of the work in addressing these tasks\nis devoted to building complex algorithmic infrastructures to process inputs in\na black-box fashion, less is known about how to exploit the various facets of\nthe data, before inputting this into an algorithm. Here, we focus on this\nlatter perspective, by proposing a physics-inspired dynamical system that\nadapts Optimal Transport principles to effectively leverage color distributions\nof images. Our dynamics regulates immiscible fluxes of colors traveling on a\nnetwork built from images. Instead of aggregating colors together, it treats\nthem as different commodities that interact with a shared capacity on edges.\nThe resulting optimal flows can then be fed into standard classifiers to\ndistinguish images in different classes. We show how our method can outperform\ncompeting approaches on image classification tasks in datasets where color\ninformation matters.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-04\narXiv paper ID: 2205.02938v2\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

However, their inherent large\nsize hinders deploying these networks on resource-constrained devices like\nedge, mobile, and IoT platforms. Strategies have emerged, from partial cloud\ncomputation offloading (split computing) to integrating early exits within DNN\nlayers. Our work presents an innovative unified approach merging early exits\nand split computing. We determine the 'splitting layer', the optimal depth in\nthe DNN for edge device computations, and whether to infer on edge device or be\noffloaded to the cloud for inference considering accuracy, computational\nefficiency, and communication costs. Also, Image classification faces diverse\nenvironmental distortions, influenced by factors like time of day, lighting,\nand weather. To adapt to these distortions, we introduce I-SplitEE, an online\nunsupervised algorithm ideal for scenarios lacking ground truths and with\nsequential data. Experimental validation using Caltech-256 and Cifar-10\ndatasets subjected to varied distortions showcases I-SplitEE's ability to\nreduce costs by a minimum of 55% with marginal performance degradation of at\nmost 5%.\nPublication Date: 2024-01-19\narXiv paper ID: 2401.10541v1\n\nTitle: Task-Oriented Real-time Visual Inference for IoVT Systems: A Co-design Framework of Neural Networks and Edge Deployment\nSummary: As the volume of image data grows, data-oriented cloud computing in Internet\nof Video Things (IoVT) systems encounters latency issues. Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

Data transmissions from devices to\nservers are often over local wireless networks whose bandwidth is not just\nlimited but, more importantly, variable. Furthermore, in cyber-physical systems\ninteracting with the physical environment, image offloading is also commonly\nsubject to timing constraints. It is, therefore, important to develop an\nadaptive approach that maximizes the inference performance of ML applications\nunder timing constraints and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In this\npaper, we use image classification as our target application and propose\nprogressive neural compression (PNC) as an efficient solution to this problem.\nAlthough neural compression has been used to compress images for different ML\napplications, existing solutions often produce fixed-size outputs that are\nunsuitable for timing-constrained offloading over variable bandwidth. To\naddress this limitation, we train a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that\noptimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a\ncompression solution that produces features ordered according to their\nimportance to inference performance. Features are then transmitted in that\norder based on available bandwidth, with classification ultimately performed\nusing the (sub)set of features received by the deadline. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of PNC over state-of-the-art neural compression approaches and\ntraditional compression methods on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an\nedge server connected over a wireless network with varying bandwidth.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-08\narXiv paper ID: 2310.05306v1\n\nTitle: Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies\nSummary: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and\npromising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as\nsequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their\nhigh computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges\nfor deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\nlimitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and\nhardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review\nthat systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in\naccuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains\nlacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy,\nefficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging\nresearch directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit\n(ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

Bajpai, Aastha Jaiswal, and Manjesh K. HanawalIndian Institute of Technology Bombay, IndiaEmail: {20i190003, 22n0463, mhanawal }@iitb.ac.inAbstract\u2014The recent advances in Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) stem from their exceptional performance across vari-ous domains. However, deploying these networks on resource-constrained devices\u2014like edge, mobile, and IoT platforms\u2014ishindered by their inherent large size. Strategies have emerged,from partial cloud computation offloading (split computing) tointegrating early exits within DNN layers. Our work presentsan innovative unified approach merging early exits and splitcomputing. We determine the \u2019splitting layer,\u2019 the optimal depthin the DNN for edge device computations, and whether to infer onedge device or be offloaded to the cloud for inference consideringaccuracy, computational efficiency, and communication costs.Also, Image classification faces diverse environmental distortions,influenced by factors like time of day, lighting, and weather.To adapt to these distortions, we introduce I-SplitEE, an on-line unsupervised algorithm ideal for scenarios lacking groundtruths and with sequential data. Experimental validation usingCaltech-256 and Cifar-10 datasets subjected to varied distortionsshowcases I-SplitEE\u2019s ability to reduce costs by a minimum of55% with marginal performance degradation of at most 5%.I. I NTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)has undergone substantial expansion, leading to remarkableperformance achievements [1], especially for computer visiontasks such as image classification [2]. This increased scalehas increased computational demands, rendering their deploy-ment on resource-constrained platforms like mobile and edgedevices. To mitigate the computational challenges associatedwith deploying DNNs on these devices, various strategieshave been introduced. These include approaches like SplitComputing, Early Exits, and offloading to cloud [3].Split Computing. Edge devices, often constrained by limitedprocessing capabilities, can opt to offload their data to thecloud, which boasts superior computational power. This ap-proach involves running the full-fledged Deep Neural Network(DNN) in the cloud, subsequently returning the inferencesto the edge device. However, this offloading of data to thecloud incurs latency due to communication delays between theedge device and the cloud. To harness the combined resourcesavailable on both mobile devices and the cloud, a strategyknown as \u201dsplit computing\u201d has been introduced. In splitcomputing, the DNN is bifurcated into two segments: a subsetof initial layers is deployed on the edge device, while theremaining layers are hosted in the cloud. The portion deployedon the edge device serves as an encoder for processinginput images, reducing their size and, consequently, mitigatinglatency costs. This hybrid approach facilitates edge-cloud co-inference. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that in splitcomputing, all samples still need to be inferred at the finallayer on the cloud, which, while reducing the computationalburden on edge devices, maintains significant communicationcosts, as every sample is offloaded [3].Early Exits (EE-DNNs). Several previous methods, includingBranchyNet [4], SPINN [5], and LGViT [6], enable the clas-sification of input images by adding classifiers at intermediatelayers within DNNs. In these early exit DNNs, the decisionto classify the image at an intermediate stage is contingenton the confidence of the prediction surpassing a predefinedthreshold. Exiting the network at its early layers demandsless computational resources but may lead to less precisepredictions. Conversely, deeper exits offer greater precisionbut at the cost of higher computational demands. Therefore,determining the best exit point within the network is importantto model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.In our approach, we introduce a hybrid strategy that com-bines both split computing and early exits to optimize resourceusage on both edge devices and the cloud. We define the\u201dsplitting layer\u201d as the final layer on the edge device. At thislayer, we attach an exit point for making inferences locallyon the edge device. Before an input image is transferred tothe cloud, it undergoes classification on the edge device. Ifthe prediction confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold,the process is terminated, and the image is classified on theedge. In cases where the confidence falls below the threshold,the image is offloaded to the cloud for further processing.While previous methods [7], [8] traditionally employ a fixedsplitting layer on the edge device, our approach advocates forthe adaptive selection of the splitting layer. This adaptability isparticularly crucial in real-world scenarios where input imagesoften exhibit various distortions [9]. For instance, edge devicesfrequently encounter noisy or blurred images, with differentlevels of distortion. Pacheco et al. [10] empirically illustratethe influence of noise on confidence values in images. Thedistortion in images changes the latent distribution of thedataset and significantly impacts the confidence values andinference results [7]. During inference, the data arrives in anonline (sequential order) fashion and the ground truth valuesfor the image sample are not available. Hence the questionthen arises, how to adaptively choose the optimal splittinglayer to model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off when theunderlying latent distribution of incoming data changes?To address the challenge of selecting an optimal split-arXiv:2401.10541v1  [cs.LG]  19 Jan 2024--- Page 2 ---L1 L2b1LibjLNEdge Device OffloadFig. 1. Split computing combined with early exits, where the DNN is splitinto two parts with an additional advantage of inference on mobile device.ting layer when the test data has a different distribution ascompared to the dataset used for training, we introduce anonline learning algorithm called I-SplitEE. This algorithmleverages the Multi-Armed Bandit framework [11], utilizingthe confidence in prediction as a surrogate for predictionaccuracy at the exit point. The computational cost is the costof running the DNN on edge devices, while the offloadingcost is the cost of communication delays between edge andcloud. The primary objective is to maximize prediction con-fidence while minimizing computational and offloading costs.I-SplitEE dynamically determines the optimal splitting layerfor an incoming sample based on past observations from thedataset with a given latent data distribution. I-SplitEE modelcould be adapted to different edge devices and communicationnetworks as well using user-specific inputs.For our backbone model, we adopt the lightweight Mo-bileNet V2 [12] model. This choice is an ideal testbed forour algorithm, given its efficiency and competitive accuracycompared to state-of-the-art models. We conduct experimentsunder varying levels of noise (distortion) in the dataset, asdetailed in Section V. Our experimental results on Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets demonstrate that the optimalsplitting layer differs as there are changes in the distributionof data. Specifically, I-SplitEE achieves a significant reductionin the cost (> 55%) with only a minimal drop in performance(\u2264 5%) when compared to the scenario where all samples areprocessed at the final layer.Our key contributions encompass: 1) We integrate splitcomputing and early exiting to enable early inferences for\u201deasy\u201d samples on edge devices. 2) We develop an onlinelearning algorithm I-SplitEE to dynamically select the optimalsplitting layer based on context in an online and unsupervisedmanner. 3) I-SplitEE optimizes the resource utilization acrossedge devices and the cloud. 4) We experimentally validatethat I-SplitEE minimizes performance degradation while sig-nificantly reducing costs compared to the final exit scenario.II. R ELATED WORKSIn this section, we discuss the previous works on Splitcomputing and Early Exit to use DNNs on mobile devices.Split computing for DNNs. Neurosurgeon, as introduced in[15], explores strategies for optimizing the splitting of DNNsbased on the cost considerations associated with selectinga specific splitting layer. In a similar vein, BottleNet [16]incorporates a bottleneck mechanism within split computing.This approach entails deploying a segment of the DNN onan edge device to encode the input sample into a morecompact representation before transmitting it to the cloud forfurther processing. Various training methodologies have beenproposed for training the encoder situated on the edge device.Notably, BottleNet++ employs cross-entropy-based trainingapproaches in the context of split computing.Early-Exit DNNs. Early-exit DNNs have found applicationsacross diverse tasks. In the context of image classification,BranchyNet [4] and several preceding studies utilize clas-sification entropy metrics at different intermediate layers todetermine whether early inference can be made with sufficientconfidence. Approaches like SPINN [5] incorporate earlyexits into DNN architectures, primarily aimed at handlingservice disruptions. Beyond image classification, early exitshave found relevance in various domains, spanning naturallanguage processing tasks (NLP) [17], [18].DNNs on mobile device. AdaEE [7] employs a combina-tion of early-exit DNNs and DNN partitioning to facilitateoffloading data from mobile devices using early-exit DNNs.LEE (Learning Early Exit) [19], DEE (Dynamic Early exit)[20] and UEE-UCB (Unsupervised early exits using UpperConfidence Bound) [21] leverage the multi-armed banditframework to determine optimal exit points. However, theylack the offloading and primarily focus on performing opera-tions on edge devices. LEE and DEE are specifically designedfor efficient edge device inference, particularly in cases ofservice disruptions, employing utility functions that requireaccess to ground-truth labels. Notably, UEE-UCB specializesin learning the optimal exit strategy for the ElasticBERT [18]backbone, primarily tailored for text classification tasks.Our approach distinguishes itself from prior methods inseveral key aspects. 1) We consider not only accuracy but alsocomputational and communication costs when determining theoptimal splitting layer. 2) Our method operates in an onlineand unsupervised setup, offering a novel perspective. 3) Weleverage contextual information, such as confidence scores,to dynamically determine the splitting layer for each sampleduring edge device processing.III. P ROBLEM SETUPIn our scenario, we train a deep neural network (DNN)consisting of L layers. We introduce exit points into thisbackbone after specific layers. We denote the set of layers as[L] = {1, 2, . . . , L}. The set of target classes for classificationis denoted as C. For a given image, x, and an exit attachedto layer i, we define \u02c6Pi(c) as the estimated probability that xbelongs to class c, where c belongs to C. The confidence in theestimated probability class, defined as Ci = maxc\u2208C \u02c6Pi(c), isthe maximum among these estimated probabilities.The DNN processes the image x, and the point at whichthe DNN splits can occur at any layer i where exit is attached,where the layers 1 through i reside on the edge device, andthe remaining layers i + 1 through L are processed on the--- Page 3 ---cloud. In our setup, each image requires two-stage decisions:1) Determining the optimal splitting point in the DNN, and2) Deciding whether to exit at the chosen splitting layer oroffload the task. Notably, the choice of the splitting layer relieson the collective context rather than individual samples. Thechoice to exit or offload depends on individual samples andfollows this process: When the DNN splits at the ith layer, wecalculate Ci(x) and compare it with a predefined threshold,denoted as \u03b1. If the confidence Ci(x) \u2265 \u03b1, the image sampleis inferred locally on the edge device and does not requireoffloading. Otherwise, it is offloaded to the cloud for inferenceat the final layer incurring communication costs.The cost of using the DNN up to layer i encompasses thecomputational cost of processing the image sample up to thatlayer on the edge and performing inference. We represent thecomputational cost associated with splitting at the ith layer as\u03b3i, where \u03b3i is proportional to the layer depth i. Additionally,we introduce the cost of offloading from the edge deviceto the cloud, denoted as o, which depends on factors liketransmission type (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi). We define thereward function for splitting at layer i \u2208 [L] asr(i) = Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i if Ci \u2265 \u03b1 or i = LCL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o) otherwise, (1)where \xb5 serves as a conversion factor, enabling us to representthe cost in terms of confidence. The user-defined value of \xb5reflects the user\u2019s preference and captures the balance betweenaccuracy and cost.The reward function\u2019s interpretation is as follows: when theDNN generates a confident prediction at the splitting layer,the reward is calculated as the confidence at the splittinglayer minus the cost associated with processing the sampleup to the ith layer and performing inference. In the eventof lower confidence, the sample is offloaded to the cloud,incurring offloading costs and inferring at the final layer,with the confidence of CL. If i is equal to L, the sampleis processed entirely on the edge device, eliminating the needfor offloading. For any splitting layer i \u2208 [L], the expectedreward can be expressed asE[r(i)] = E[Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i|Ci \u2265 \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci \u2265 \u03b1]+ E[CL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o)|Ci < \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci < \u03b1] (2)and for the last layer L, it is a constant given as E(r(L)) =CL \u2212 \xb5\u03b3L. The goal is to find the optimal splitting layer i\u2217defined as i\u2217 = arg maxi\u2208[L] E[r(i)].Recall (section I) that the problem of choosing optimalthresholds is in an online and unsupervised setup. In thecontext of online learning problems, the Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) [11] setup plays a pivotal role in addressing challengesrelated to dynamic decision-making. Hence, we employ anMAB framework to find the optimal splitting layer based onuser-specific arguments. In this framework, we establish ouraction set as the set of layer indices where exits are attachedin the DNN denoted as E, where each choice corresponds tosplitting the DNN at an exit point. In MAB terminology, thesechoices are referred to as \u201darms.\u201d Within this framework, wedevise a policy denoted as \u03c0 that selects arm it at each timestep t based on prior observations. We define the cumulativeregret of policy \u03c0 over T rounds asR(\u03c0, T) =TXt=1E[r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(it)] (3)where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in thearm selection caused by previous samples. A policy \u03c0\u2217 is saidto be sub-linear if the average cumulative regret vanishes, i.e.R(\u03c0\u2217, T)/T \u2192 0.IV. A LGORITHMIn this section, we develop an algorithm named I-SplitEE.The algorithm is based on the \u2019optimism in the face of un-certainty principle\u2019 and utilizes the upper confidence bounds.Algorithm 1 I-SplitEE1: Input: \u03b1 (threshold), \u03b2\u2265 1, E, \u03b3i \u2200i \u2208 E, o2: Initialize: Q(i) \u2190 0, N(i) \u2190 0.3: Initialize by playing each arm once.4: for t = |E| + 1, |E| + 2, . . .do5: Observe an instance xt6: it \u2190 arg maxi\u2208EQ(i) + \u03b2qln(t)N(i)7: Pass xt till layer it, use threshold \u03b1 and observe Cit8: if Cit \u2265 \u03b1 then9: Infer at layer it and exit10: rt(it) \u2190 Cit (xt) \u2212 \xb5\u03b3it , Nt(it) \u2190 Nt\u22121(it) + 111: Qt(it) \u2190 Ptj=1 rj(k)1 {k=it}/Nt(it)12: else13: Offload to the last layer.

The pseudo-code ofthe algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The working of thealgorithm could be explained as follows: It plays each armonce to obtain rewards Q(i) and counters N(i) for each layerwith an attached exit. After observing each arm once, it playsan arm it that maximizes the UCB index (line 6) in succeedingrounds. UCB index comprises the weighted sum of empiricalaverages of rewards Q(i) and the confidence bonuses. Thesample is then processed till the splitting layer it and if theconfidence is above the threshold \u03b1, the sample exits theDNN; else the sample is offloaded to the cloud with additionalcost o.From the analysis of UCB1 [22], one can easily verify thatI-SplitEE achieves a sub-linear regret. The observed regret isOPi\u2208A\\i\u2217log(n)\u2206iwhere \u2206i = r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(i).--- Page 4 ---0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost (x100)Cost over Pristine (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 0.5 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 1 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 2 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 3 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEEFig. 2.

E XPERIMENTSIn this section, we provide all the experimental details ofthe paper. There are two key phases in our experimentalsetup. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SplitEE-5DE5/README.md.1) Training the backbone: To evaluate I-SplitEE, wetrain the MobileNet V2 model with 6 task-specific exits atintermediate points and the final exit. The placement of exitsis strategically chosen as described in some previous works[7], [23]. The dataset used for training is the Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets. We closely follow the trainingprocedure as described in the paper [7], [19]. The Caltech-256dataset contains undistorted images of objects such as bikes,bears, camels etc. The dataset has a total of 257 differentclasses. The Cifar-10 dataset consists of 10 classes and alsohas a classification task. For the training of the backbone, wesplit the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation andremaining as the test set. Note that after this step no traininghappens. Except in table II, all the given results are from theCaltech-256 dataset due to space constraints.2) Unsupervised learning of Splitting layer based onunderlying distribution: The change in distribution can bedefined by multiple environmental effects, however, we focuson the change as image distortion. Following the training ofthe DNN with attached exits, we apply Gaussian noise asimage distortion on each image from the test set. Gaussiannoise occurs when the camera goes out of focus or the imageis from a foggy environment. To make an image noisy, weadd Gaussian noise to an image with zero mean and standarddeviation \u03c3 to an undistorted image. More standard deviationadds more noise to an image. We vary the standard deviationas \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}.After adding the noise to the image we employ I-SplitEEto find the optimal splitting layer based on the change indistortion present in the image. The predefined threshold islearned on the validation set of the model and is set to 0.6 forCaltech and 0.9 for Cifar-10 as learned by the model. We alsohave two types of costs: 1) Computational cost: As explainedin section III, the computational cost is directly proportionalto the number of layers being processed on the edge device i.e.\u03b3i = \u03bbi where \u03bb is the computational cost for a single layer.\u03bb is user-defined and depends on the processing power ofthe user\u2019s device. We experimented with different processingcost values but due to space constraints, the results are notprovided. However, we set \u03bb = 0 .1 thus normalizing thecost for direct comparison. 2) Offloading cost is also user-defined and depends on the communication network used (e.g.3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi). Hence, we experiment with differentoffloading costs from the set o \u2208 {0.2, 0.4, . . . ,1.0} and show(see subsection V-C) that I-SplitEE gets better results fromother baselines making it robust to different communicationnetworks. For the main results in table I, we fix the offloadingcost as o = 1.0 which is the worst-case scenario. More detailson how to compute the offloading cost can be found in [24].We run all the experiments 10 times and average theresults. The action set is the set of attached exits A ={3, 6, . . .18, 20}. We set the trade-off factor \xb5 = 1 whichcould be varied based on the user\u2019s preferences for accuracyand cost. Smaller values of \xb5 will provide accurate resultsbut with higher costs and vice versa. All the experiments areperformed on a single NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. The trainingrequires \u223c 10 hours of GPU runtime for Caltech-256 and \u223c 7hours for Cifar-10 with all the exits. Learning of the optimalsplitting layer could be executed quickly using the CPU.--- Page 5 ---TABLE IIN THIS TABLE , WE PROVIDE THE % REDUCTION IN COST AS WELL AS ACCURACY WITH DIFFERENT DISTORTION LEVELS \u03c3 ON CALTECH -256 DATASET.Model/Distortion \u03c3 = 0.0 \u03c3 = 0.5 \u03c3 = 1 \u03c3 = 1.5 \u03c3 = 2 \u03c3 = 3Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc CostFinal layer 78.5 100 75.2 100 71.6 100 69.8 100 67.8 100 64.1 100Random exit -4.1 -33.5% -3.4 -20.1% -5.1 -39.7% -7.2 -41.3% -6.2 -37.8% -9.5 -43.9%AdaEE -3.3 -45.8% -4.2 -47.1% -4.6 -47.4% -5.8 -49.7% -5.7 -53.0% -5.2 -50.2%Early-Exit -5.3 -39.2% -9.1 -38.5% -9.9 -38.5% -10.5 -38.8% -10.1 -38.4% -10.8 -37.8%I-SplitEE -2.0 -66.3% -2.1 -65.9% -3.9 -66.7% -5.0 -67.4% -4.8 -66.4% -4.7 -65.7%A. Baselines1) Final-layer: We form this as our main baseline as itis similar to the MobileNet\u2019s inference. However, added exitsmight marginally deteriorate the performance.2) Random exit: We randomly choose a splitting layer andthen exploit that layer for the complete dataset. We choosethe random splitting layer for 10 times and then average theresults provided in table I.3) AdaEE: fixes the splitting layer and then adaptivelychooses the threshold as given in the paper [7]. There isan option to offload but the splitting layer is fixed. All thehyperparameters were kept the same as in the paper.4) Early-Exit: is similar to the classic early exiting setupwhere all the samples are inferred at the edge device and basedon the confidence values being above a given threshold. Thesample passes through the backbone until it obtains sufficientconfidence.B. Impact of change in distortionTo gain a deeper understanding of the influence of im-age distortion, we conducted an analysis of the confi-dence values associated with the final layer of our model.Pristine= 0.0noise= 0.5noise= 1noise= 1.5noise= 2noise= 2.5noise= 3Distortion0.20.40.60.81.0ConfidenceFig. 4.

The visualrepresentation inthis figure servesas a compellingillustration of the significant impact that image distortionexerts on the model\u2019s confidence. There is a loss in confidenceas the distortion in images increases and might affect themodel if a fixed splitting layer is used. This observationcompels us to adaptively choose the splitting layer as witha change in the underlying distribution of the dataset thedistribution of confidence values also changes at differentexits including the final exit.TABLE IISIMILAR RESULTS AS IN TABLE I FOR CIFAR -10.

Analysis over different overheadsGiven that the offloading cost is a user-defined parameter,we conducted a comprehensive analysis by varying this costwithin the set of values {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} in figure 2.This exploration focused on examining the behaviour of bothaccuracy and cost under different offloading cost scenarios.As the offloading cost increases, it is unsurprising that theoverall cost also rises. Notably, this increase in the offloadingcost does not result in a significant impact on accuracy. Thisobservation suggests the robustness of I-SplitEE to variationsin offloading cost, ensuring that accuracy remains relativelystable. However, we observe that the choice of the optimalsplitting layer adjusts with shifts in the offloading cost. Whenthe offloading cost is elevated, I-SplitEE opts for a deepersplitting layer, aligning with expectations, as the computa-tional cost becomes relatively smaller compared to the offload-ing cost. Consequently, the algorithm\u2019s design prompts thesample to be locally inferred on the edge device. Remarkably,this decision does not compromise the accuracy of the model,due to offloading of samples with low confidence on the edgedevice. As a result, every prediction maintains a high level ofconfidence, resulting in only a marginal reduction in accuracy.Moreover, our analysis reveals that even from a cost per-spective, our model outperforms the early-exit baseline. Thisfinding strengthens the claims regarding the efficacy of I-SplitEE and its ability to strike a compelling balance betweenaccuracy and cost.VI. R ESULTSIn Table I, II, we present the significant outcomes of I-SplitEE, providing insights into accuracy and cost metricsfor images exhibiting varying levels of distortion. Notably,our proposed method, I-SplitEE, demonstrates its remark-able performance by yielding the smallest performance drop(\u2264 5%) and the most substantial cost reduction ( > 65%) incomparison to the final exit. The cost values in the table are--- Page 6 ---computed as the cumulative sum of both computational andoffloading costs over the entire dataset. It is worth notingthat both the \u201dFinal Layer\u201d and \u201dEarly Exit\u201d baselines entailexecuting all computations on the mobile device, resulting ina significant computational cost that impacts the efficiency ofthe edge device. The accuracy loss observed in the \u201dEarlyExit\u201d scenario primarily stems from misclassifications madeby intermediate classifiers, which are subsequently rectifiedin the deeper layers. On the other hand, both \u201dRandom Exit\u201dand \u201dAdaEE\u201d provide an option to offload, but they havefixed splitting layers, preventing dynamic adaptation of thesplitting point. \u201dAdaEE,\u201d however, possesses the advantageof adjusting thresholds based on contextual information.Comparing our method with other baselines, I-SplitEEshowcases a remarkable reduction in cost by efficiently opti-mizing resource utilization on both edge and cloud platforms.The distinct advantage of I-SplitEE lies in its adaptive nature,enabling it to select the optimal splitting layer based on pastsamples. It accounts for a minimal reduction in accuracydue to offloading to the cloud. Overall, I-SplitEE effectivelyoptimizes resource utilization across both mobile devices andcloud infrastructure by balancing the computational as wellas communication costs.VII. C ONCLUSIONWe address the problem of executing the DNNs on edgedevices by considering the resources available on the edge.We propose a method that combines early exits and splitcomputing to reduce the computational cost of inference onedge devices as well as communication costs to the cloud.The developed algorithm I-SplitEE splits the DNN based onthe resources available where the initial part of the DNN isdeployed on the edge device with an exit attached at thelast layer on the edge device. If the sample gains sufficientconfidence on the edge device, it is inferred locally, else itis offloaded to the cloud for inference on the final layer ofDNN. I-SplitEE adapts to changes in the distribution of thetest data when it data arrives in an online and unsupervised.Notably, I-SplitEE has a minimal drop in accuracy even whencost changes making it more robust to different user-specificdevices.Our work could be extended by simultaneously adaptingto the optimal threshold as well as the splitting layer. Also,our method finds the optimal splitting layer based on all thesamples, however, the splitting layer could be learned basedon the difficulty level of the individual samples.REFERENCES[1] K.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The\ncombination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances\ncompression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with\nnumber of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy. The deployment\nof the final compressed model on edge device demonstrates high accuracy 92.5%\nand low inference time 20 ms, validating the effectiveness of compression\ntechniques for real-world edge computing applications.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-02\narXiv paper ID: 2409.02134v1\n\nTitle: Are Visual Recognition Models Robust to Image Compression?\nSummary: Reducing the data footprint of visual content via image compression is\nessential to reduce storage requirements, but also to reduce the bandwidth and\nlatency requirements for transmission. In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously.

Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization. That meets practical\ndemands for automated poultry health monitoring using lightweight intelligent\ncameras with low power consumption and minimal bandwidth costs.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-03\narXiv paper ID: 2407.09562v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated. Experiments on standard image\nclassification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in\nparticular, under imbalanced target network configurations that were not\nstudied before.\nPublication Date: 2020-07-07\narXiv paper ID: 2007.03154v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2409.08943v1\n```\nStep #26, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2409.08943v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge device image classification energy efficiency optimization\n```\nStep #27, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge device image classification energy efficiency optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems.

This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #29, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification dynamic computation optimization\n```\nStep #30, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification dynamic computation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification\nSummary: In classification tasks, it is crucial to meaningfully exploit the\ninformation contained in data.

Our dynamics regulates immiscible fluxes of colors traveling on a\nnetwork built from images. Instead of aggregating colors together, it treats\nthem as different commodities that interact with a shared capacity on edges.\nThe resulting optimal flows can then be fed into standard classifiers to\ndistinguish images in different classes.

The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

However, their inherent large\nsize hinders deploying these networks on resource-constrained devices like\nedge, mobile, and IoT platforms. Strategies have emerged, from partial cloud\ncomputation offloading (split computing) to integrating early exits within DNN\nlayers. Our work presents an innovative unified approach merging early exits\nand split computing. We determine the 'splitting layer', the optimal depth in\nthe DNN for edge device computations, and whether to infer on edge device or be\noffloaded to the cloud for inference considering accuracy, computational\nefficiency, and communication costs. Also, Image classification faces diverse\nenvironmental distortions, influenced by factors like time of day, lighting,\nand weather. To adapt to these distortions, we introduce I-SplitEE, an online\nunsupervised algorithm ideal for scenarios lacking ground truths and with\nsequential data. Experimental validation using Caltech-256 and Cifar-10\ndatasets subjected to varied distortions showcases I-SplitEE's ability to\nreduce costs by a minimum of 55% with marginal performance degradation of at\nmost 5%.\nPublication Date: 2024-01-19\narXiv paper ID: 2401.10541v1\n\nTitle: Task-Oriented Real-time Visual Inference for IoVT Systems: A Co-design Framework of Neural Networks and Edge Deployment\nSummary: As the volume of image data grows, data-oriented cloud computing in Internet\nof Video Things (IoVT) systems encounters latency issues. Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models.

Furthermore, in cyber-physical systems\ninteracting with the physical environment, image offloading is also commonly\nsubject to timing constraints. It is, therefore, important to develop an\nadaptive approach that maximizes the inference performance of ML applications\nunder timing constraints and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In this\npaper, we use image classification as our target application and propose\nprogressive neural compression (PNC) as an efficient solution to this problem.\nAlthough neural compression has been used to compress images for different ML\napplications, existing solutions often produce fixed-size outputs that are\nunsuitable for timing-constrained offloading over variable bandwidth. To\naddress this limitation, we train a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that\noptimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a\ncompression solution that produces features ordered according to their\nimportance to inference performance. Features are then transmitted in that\norder based on available bandwidth, with classification ultimately performed\nusing the (sub)set of features received by the deadline. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of PNC over state-of-the-art neural compression approaches and\ntraditional compression methods on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an\nedge server connected over a wireless network with varying bandwidth.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-08\narXiv paper ID: 2310.05306v1\n\nTitle: Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies\nSummary: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and\npromising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as\nsequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their\nhigh computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges\nfor deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\nlimitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and\nhardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review\nthat systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in\naccuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains\nlacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy,\nefficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging\nresearch directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit\n(ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire\nfurther research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient\ndeployment on edge devices.\nPublication Date: 2025-02-26\narXiv paper ID: 2503.02891v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices.

Bajpai, Aastha Jaiswal, and Manjesh K. HanawalIndian Institute of Technology Bombay, IndiaEmail: {20i190003, 22n0463, mhanawal }@iitb.ac.inAbstract\u2014The recent advances in Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) stem from their exceptional performance across vari-ous domains. However, deploying these networks on resource-constrained devices\u2014like edge, mobile, and IoT platforms\u2014ishindered by their inherent large size. Strategies have emerged,from partial cloud computation offloading (split computing) tointegrating early exits within DNN layers. Our work presentsan innovative unified approach merging early exits and splitcomputing. We determine the \u2019splitting layer,\u2019 the optimal depthin the DNN for edge device computations, and whether to infer onedge device or be offloaded to the cloud for inference consideringaccuracy, computational efficiency, and communication costs.Also, Image classification faces diverse environmental distortions,influenced by factors like time of day, lighting, and weather.To adapt to these distortions, we introduce I-SplitEE, an on-line unsupervised algorithm ideal for scenarios lacking groundtruths and with sequential data. Experimental validation usingCaltech-256 and Cifar-10 datasets subjected to varied distortionsshowcases I-SplitEE\u2019s ability to reduce costs by a minimum of55% with marginal performance degradation of at most 5%.I. I NTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)has undergone substantial expansion, leading to remarkableperformance achievements [1], especially for computer visiontasks such as image classification [2]. This increased scalehas increased computational demands, rendering their deploy-ment on resource-constrained platforms like mobile and edgedevices. To mitigate the computational challenges associatedwith deploying DNNs on these devices, various strategieshave been introduced. These include approaches like SplitComputing, Early Exits, and offloading to cloud [3].Split Computing. Edge devices, often constrained by limitedprocessing capabilities, can opt to offload their data to thecloud, which boasts superior computational power. This ap-proach involves running the full-fledged Deep Neural Network(DNN) in the cloud, subsequently returning the inferencesto the edge device. However, this offloading of data to thecloud incurs latency due to communication delays between theedge device and the cloud. To harness the combined resourcesavailable on both mobile devices and the cloud, a strategyknown as \u201dsplit computing\u201d has been introduced. In splitcomputing, the DNN is bifurcated into two segments: a subsetof initial layers is deployed on the edge device, while theremaining layers are hosted in the cloud. The portion deployedon the edge device serves as an encoder for processinginput images, reducing their size and, consequently, mitigatinglatency costs. This hybrid approach facilitates edge-cloud co-inference. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that in splitcomputing, all samples still need to be inferred at the finallayer on the cloud, which, while reducing the computationalburden on edge devices, maintains significant communicationcosts, as every sample is offloaded [3].Early Exits (EE-DNNs). Several previous methods, includingBranchyNet [4], SPINN [5], and LGViT [6], enable the clas-sification of input images by adding classifiers at intermediatelayers within DNNs. In these early exit DNNs, the decisionto classify the image at an intermediate stage is contingenton the confidence of the prediction surpassing a predefinedthreshold. Exiting the network at its early layers demandsless computational resources but may lead to less precisepredictions. Conversely, deeper exits offer greater precisionbut at the cost of higher computational demands. Therefore,determining the best exit point within the network is importantto model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.In our approach, we introduce a hybrid strategy that com-bines both split computing and early exits to optimize resourceusage on both edge devices and the cloud. We define the\u201dsplitting layer\u201d as the final layer on the edge device. At thislayer, we attach an exit point for making inferences locallyon the edge device. Before an input image is transferred tothe cloud, it undergoes classification on the edge device. Ifthe prediction confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold,the process is terminated, and the image is classified on theedge. In cases where the confidence falls below the threshold,the image is offloaded to the cloud for further processing.While previous methods [7], [8] traditionally employ a fixedsplitting layer on the edge device, our approach advocates forthe adaptive selection of the splitting layer. This adaptability isparticularly crucial in real-world scenarios where input imagesoften exhibit various distortions [9]. For instance, edge devicesfrequently encounter noisy or blurred images, with differentlevels of distortion. Pacheco et al. [10] empirically illustratethe influence of noise on confidence values in images. Thedistortion in images changes the latent distribution of thedataset and significantly impacts the confidence values andinference results [7]. During inference, the data arrives in anonline (sequential order) fashion and the ground truth valuesfor the image sample are not available. Hence the questionthen arises, how to adaptively choose the optimal splittinglayer to model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off when theunderlying latent distribution of incoming data changes?To address the challenge of selecting an optimal split-arXiv:2401.10541v1  [cs.LG]  19 Jan 2024--- Page 2 ---L1 L2b1LibjLNEdge Device OffloadFig. 1. Split computing combined with early exits, where the DNN is splitinto two parts with an additional advantage of inference on mobile device.ting layer when the test data has a different distribution ascompared to the dataset used for training, we introduce anonline learning algorithm called I-SplitEE. This algorithmleverages the Multi-Armed Bandit framework [11], utilizingthe confidence in prediction as a surrogate for predictionaccuracy at the exit point. The computational cost is the costof running the DNN on edge devices, while the offloadingcost is the cost of communication delays between edge andcloud. The primary objective is to maximize prediction con-fidence while minimizing computational and offloading costs.I-SplitEE dynamically determines the optimal splitting layerfor an incoming sample based on past observations from thedataset with a given latent data distribution. I-SplitEE modelcould be adapted to different edge devices and communicationnetworks as well using user-specific inputs.For our backbone model, we adopt the lightweight Mo-bileNet V2 [12] model. This choice is an ideal testbed forour algorithm, given its efficiency and competitive accuracycompared to state-of-the-art models. We conduct experimentsunder varying levels of noise (distortion) in the dataset, asdetailed in Section V. Our experimental results on Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets demonstrate that the optimalsplitting layer differs as there are changes in the distributionof data. Specifically, I-SplitEE achieves a significant reductionin the cost (> 55%) with only a minimal drop in performance(\u2264 5%) when compared to the scenario where all samples areprocessed at the final layer.Our key contributions encompass: 1) We integrate splitcomputing and early exiting to enable early inferences for\u201deasy\u201d samples on edge devices. 2) We develop an onlinelearning algorithm I-SplitEE to dynamically select the optimalsplitting layer based on context in an online and unsupervisedmanner. 3) I-SplitEE optimizes the resource utilization acrossedge devices and the cloud. 4) We experimentally validatethat I-SplitEE minimizes performance degradation while sig-nificantly reducing costs compared to the final exit scenario.II. R ELATED WORKSIn this section, we discuss the previous works on Splitcomputing and Early Exit to use DNNs on mobile devices.Split computing for DNNs. Neurosurgeon, as introduced in[15], explores strategies for optimizing the splitting of DNNsbased on the cost considerations associated with selectinga specific splitting layer. In a similar vein, BottleNet [16]incorporates a bottleneck mechanism within split computing.This approach entails deploying a segment of the DNN onan edge device to encode the input sample into a morecompact representation before transmitting it to the cloud forfurther processing. Various training methodologies have beenproposed for training the encoder situated on the edge device.Notably, BottleNet++ employs cross-entropy-based trainingapproaches in the context of split computing.Early-Exit DNNs. Early-exit DNNs have found applicationsacross diverse tasks. In the context of image classification,BranchyNet [4] and several preceding studies utilize clas-sification entropy metrics at different intermediate layers todetermine whether early inference can be made with sufficientconfidence. Approaches like SPINN [5] incorporate earlyexits into DNN architectures, primarily aimed at handlingservice disruptions. Beyond image classification, early exitshave found relevance in various domains, spanning naturallanguage processing tasks (NLP) [17], [18].DNNs on mobile device. AdaEE [7] employs a combina-tion of early-exit DNNs and DNN partitioning to facilitateoffloading data from mobile devices using early-exit DNNs.LEE (Learning Early Exit) [19], DEE (Dynamic Early exit)[20] and UEE-UCB (Unsupervised early exits using UpperConfidence Bound) [21] leverage the multi-armed banditframework to determine optimal exit points. However, theylack the offloading and primarily focus on performing opera-tions on edge devices. LEE and DEE are specifically designedfor efficient edge device inference, particularly in cases ofservice disruptions, employing utility functions that requireaccess to ground-truth labels. Notably, UEE-UCB specializesin learning the optimal exit strategy for the ElasticBERT [18]backbone, primarily tailored for text classification tasks.Our approach distinguishes itself from prior methods inseveral key aspects. 1) We consider not only accuracy but alsocomputational and communication costs when determining theoptimal splitting layer. 2) Our method operates in an onlineand unsupervised setup, offering a novel perspective. 3) Weleverage contextual information, such as confidence scores,to dynamically determine the splitting layer for each sampleduring edge device processing.III. P ROBLEM SETUPIn our scenario, we train a deep neural network (DNN)consisting of L layers. We introduce exit points into thisbackbone after specific layers. We denote the set of layers as[L] = {1, 2, . . . , L}. The set of target classes for classificationis denoted as C. For a given image, x, and an exit attachedto layer i, we define \u02c6Pi(c) as the estimated probability that xbelongs to class c, where c belongs to C. The confidence in theestimated probability class, defined as Ci = maxc\u2208C \u02c6Pi(c), isthe maximum among these estimated probabilities.The DNN processes the image x, and the point at whichthe DNN splits can occur at any layer i where exit is attached,where the layers 1 through i reside on the edge device, andthe remaining layers i + 1 through L are processed on the--- Page 3 ---cloud. In our setup, each image requires two-stage decisions:1) Determining the optimal splitting point in the DNN, and2) Deciding whether to exit at the chosen splitting layer oroffload the task. Notably, the choice of the splitting layer relieson the collective context rather than individual samples. Thechoice to exit or offload depends on individual samples andfollows this process: When the DNN splits at the ith layer, wecalculate Ci(x) and compare it with a predefined threshold,denoted as \u03b1. If the confidence Ci(x) \u2265 \u03b1, the image sampleis inferred locally on the edge device and does not requireoffloading. Otherwise, it is offloaded to the cloud for inferenceat the final layer incurring communication costs.The cost of using the DNN up to layer i encompasses thecomputational cost of processing the image sample up to thatlayer on the edge and performing inference. We represent thecomputational cost associated with splitting at the ith layer as\u03b3i, where \u03b3i is proportional to the layer depth i. Additionally,we introduce the cost of offloading from the edge deviceto the cloud, denoted as o, which depends on factors liketransmission type (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi). We define thereward function for splitting at layer i \u2208 [L] asr(i) = Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i if Ci \u2265 \u03b1 or i = LCL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o) otherwise, (1)where \xb5 serves as a conversion factor, enabling us to representthe cost in terms of confidence. The user-defined value of \xb5reflects the user\u2019s preference and captures the balance betweenaccuracy and cost.The reward function\u2019s interpretation is as follows: when theDNN generates a confident prediction at the splitting layer,the reward is calculated as the confidence at the splittinglayer minus the cost associated with processing the sampleup to the ith layer and performing inference. In the eventof lower confidence, the sample is offloaded to the cloud,incurring offloading costs and inferring at the final layer,with the confidence of CL. If i is equal to L, the sampleis processed entirely on the edge device, eliminating the needfor offloading. For any splitting layer i \u2208 [L], the expectedreward can be expressed asE[r(i)] = E[Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i|Ci \u2265 \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci \u2265 \u03b1]+ E[CL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o)|Ci < \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci < \u03b1] (2)and for the last layer L, it is a constant given as E(r(L)) =CL \u2212 \xb5\u03b3L. The goal is to find the optimal splitting layer i\u2217defined as i\u2217 = arg maxi\u2208[L] E[r(i)].Recall (section I) that the problem of choosing optimalthresholds is in an online and unsupervised setup. In thecontext of online learning problems, the Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) [11] setup plays a pivotal role in addressing challengesrelated to dynamic decision-making. Hence, we employ anMAB framework to find the optimal splitting layer based onuser-specific arguments. In this framework, we establish ouraction set as the set of layer indices where exits are attachedin the DNN denoted as E, where each choice corresponds tosplitting the DNN at an exit point. In MAB terminology, thesechoices are referred to as \u201darms.\u201d Within this framework, wedevise a policy denoted as \u03c0 that selects arm it at each timestep t based on prior observations. We define the cumulativeregret of policy \u03c0 over T rounds asR(\u03c0, T) =TXt=1E[r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(it)] (3)where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in thearm selection caused by previous samples. A policy \u03c0\u2217 is saidto be sub-linear if the average cumulative regret vanishes, i.e.R(\u03c0\u2217, T)/T \u2192 0.IV. A LGORITHMIn this section, we develop an algorithm named I-SplitEE.The algorithm is based on the \u2019optimism in the face of un-certainty principle\u2019 and utilizes the upper confidence bounds.Algorithm 1 I-SplitEE1: Input: \u03b1 (threshold), \u03b2\u2265 1, E, \u03b3i \u2200i \u2208 E, o2: Initialize: Q(i) \u2190 0, N(i) \u2190 0.3: Initialize by playing each arm once.4: for t = |E| + 1, |E| + 2, . . .do5: Observe an instance xt6: it \u2190 arg maxi\u2208EQ(i) + \u03b2qln(t)N(i)7: Pass xt till layer it, use threshold \u03b1 and observe Cit8: if Cit \u2265 \u03b1 then9: Infer at layer it and exit10: rt(it) \u2190 Cit (xt) \u2212 \xb5\u03b3it , Nt(it) \u2190 Nt\u22121(it) + 111: Qt(it) \u2190 Ptj=1 rj(k)1 {k=it}/Nt(it)12: else13: Offload to the last layer.

The pseudo-code ofthe algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The working of thealgorithm could be explained as follows: It plays each armonce to obtain rewards Q(i) and counters N(i) for each layerwith an attached exit. After observing each arm once, it playsan arm it that maximizes the UCB index (line 6) in succeedingrounds. UCB index comprises the weighted sum of empiricalaverages of rewards Q(i) and the confidence bonuses. Thesample is then processed till the splitting layer it and if theconfidence is above the threshold \u03b1, the sample exits theDNN; else the sample is offloaded to the cloud with additionalcost o.From the analysis of UCB1 [22], one can easily verify thatI-SplitEE achieves a sub-linear regret. The observed regret isOPi\u2208A\\i\u2217log(n)\u2206iwhere \u2206i = r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(i).--- Page 4 ---0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost (x100)Cost over Pristine (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 0.5 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 1 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 2 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEE0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Offloading Cost (o)30405060Cost over = 3 (I-SplitEE)Early ExitI-SplitEEFig. 2.

E XPERIMENTSIn this section, we provide all the experimental details ofthe paper. There are two key phases in our experimentalsetup. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SplitEE-5DE5/README.md.1) Training the backbone: To evaluate I-SplitEE, wetrain the MobileNet V2 model with 6 task-specific exits atintermediate points and the final exit. The placement of exitsis strategically chosen as described in some previous works[7], [23]. The dataset used for training is the Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets. We closely follow the trainingprocedure as described in the paper [7], [19]. The Caltech-256dataset contains undistorted images of objects such as bikes,bears, camels etc. The dataset has a total of 257 differentclasses. The Cifar-10 dataset consists of 10 classes and alsohas a classification task. For the training of the backbone, wesplit the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation andremaining as the test set. Note that after this step no traininghappens. Except in table II, all the given results are from theCaltech-256 dataset due to space constraints.2) Unsupervised learning of Splitting layer based onunderlying distribution: The change in distribution can bedefined by multiple environmental effects, however, we focuson the change as image distortion. Following the training ofthe DNN with attached exits, we apply Gaussian noise asimage distortion on each image from the test set. Gaussiannoise occurs when the camera goes out of focus or the imageis from a foggy environment. To make an image noisy, weadd Gaussian noise to an image with zero mean and standarddeviation \u03c3 to an undistorted image. More standard deviationadds more noise to an image. We vary the standard deviationas \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}.After adding the noise to the image we employ I-SplitEEto find the optimal splitting layer based on the change indistortion present in the image. The predefined threshold islearned on the validation set of the model and is set to 0.6 forCaltech and 0.9 for Cifar-10 as learned by the model. We alsohave two types of costs: 1) Computational cost: As explainedin section III, the computational cost is directly proportionalto the number of layers being processed on the edge device i.e.\u03b3i = \u03bbi where \u03bb is the computational cost for a single layer.\u03bb is user-defined and depends on the processing power ofthe user\u2019s device. We experimented with different processingcost values but due to space constraints, the results are notprovided. However, we set \u03bb = 0 .1 thus normalizing thecost for direct comparison. 2) Offloading cost is also user-defined and depends on the communication network used (e.g.3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi). Hence, we experiment with differentoffloading costs from the set o \u2208 {0.2, 0.4, . . . ,1.0} and show(see subsection V-C) that I-SplitEE gets better results fromother baselines making it robust to different communicationnetworks. For the main results in table I, we fix the offloadingcost as o = 1.0 which is the worst-case scenario. More detailson how to compute the offloading cost can be found in [24].We run all the experiments 10 times and average theresults. The action set is the set of attached exits A ={3, 6, . . .18, 20}. We set the trade-off factor \xb5 = 1 whichcould be varied based on the user\u2019s preferences for accuracyand cost. Smaller values of \xb5 will provide accurate resultsbut with higher costs and vice versa. All the experiments areperformed on a single NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. The trainingrequires \u223c 10 hours of GPU runtime for Caltech-256 and \u223c 7hours for Cifar-10 with all the exits. Learning of the optimalsplitting layer could be executed quickly using the CPU.--- Page 5 ---TABLE IIN THIS TABLE , WE PROVIDE THE % REDUCTION IN COST AS WELL AS ACCURACY WITH DIFFERENT DISTORTION LEVELS \u03c3 ON CALTECH -256 DATASET.Model/Distortion \u03c3 = 0.0 \u03c3 = 0.5 \u03c3 = 1 \u03c3 = 1.5 \u03c3 = 2 \u03c3 = 3Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc CostFinal layer 78.5 100 75.2 100 71.6 100 69.8 100 67.8 100 64.1 100Random exit -4.1 -33.5% -3.4 -20.1% -5.1 -39.7% -7.2 -41.3% -6.2 -37.8% -9.5 -43.9%AdaEE -3.3 -45.8% -4.2 -47.1% -4.6 -47.4% -5.8 -49.7% -5.7 -53.0% -5.2 -50.2%Early-Exit -5.3 -39.2% -9.1 -38.5% -9.9 -38.5% -10.5 -38.8% -10.1 -38.4% -10.8 -37.8%I-SplitEE -2.0 -66.3% -2.1 -65.9% -3.9 -66.7% -5.0 -67.4% -4.8 -66.4% -4.7 -65.7%A. Baselines1) Final-layer: We form this as our main baseline as itis similar to the MobileNet\u2019s inference. However, added exitsmight marginally deteriorate the performance.2) Random exit: We randomly choose a splitting layer andthen exploit that layer for the complete dataset. We choosethe random splitting layer for 10 times and then average theresults provided in table I.3) AdaEE: fixes the splitting layer and then adaptivelychooses the threshold as given in the paper [7]. There isan option to offload but the splitting layer is fixed. All thehyperparameters were kept the same as in the paper.4) Early-Exit: is similar to the classic early exiting setupwhere all the samples are inferred at the edge device and basedon the confidence values being above a given threshold.

Impact of change in distortionTo gain a deeper understanding of the influence of im-age distortion, we conducted an analysis of the confi-dence values associated with the final layer of our model.Pristine= 0.0noise= 0.5noise= 1noise= 1.5noise= 2noise= 2.5noise= 3Distortion0.20.40.60.81.0ConfidenceFig. 4.

The visualrepresentation inthis figure servesas a compellingillustration of the significant impact that image distortionexerts on the model\u2019s confidence. There is a loss in confidenceas the distortion in images increases and might affect themodel if a fixed splitting layer is used. This observationcompels us to adaptively choose the splitting layer as witha change in the underlying distribution of the dataset thedistribution of confidence values also changes at differentexits including the final exit.TABLE IISIMILAR RESULTS AS IN TABLE I FOR CIFAR -10.

Analysis over different overheadsGiven that the offloading cost is a user-defined parameter,we conducted a comprehensive analysis by varying this costwithin the set of values {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} in figure 2.This exploration focused on examining the behaviour of bothaccuracy and cost under different offloading cost scenarios.As the offloading cost increases, it is unsurprising that theoverall cost also rises. Notably, this increase in the offloadingcost does not result in a significant impact on accuracy. Thisobservation suggests the robustness of I-SplitEE to variationsin offloading cost, ensuring that accuracy remains relativelystable. However, we observe that the choice of the optimalsplitting layer adjusts with shifts in the offloading cost. Whenthe offloading cost is elevated, I-SplitEE opts for a deepersplitting layer, aligning with expectations, as the computa-tional cost becomes relatively smaller compared to the offload-ing cost. Consequently, the algorithm\u2019s design prompts thesample to be locally inferred on the edge device. Remarkably,this decision does not compromise the accuracy of the model,due to offloading of samples with low confidence on the edgedevice. As a result, every prediction maintains a high level ofconfidence, resulting in only a marginal reduction in accuracy.Moreover, our analysis reveals that even from a cost per-spective, our model outperforms the early-exit baseline. Thisfinding strengthens the claims regarding the efficacy of I-SplitEE and its ability to strike a compelling balance betweenaccuracy and cost.VI. R ESULTSIn Table I, II, we present the significant outcomes of I-SplitEE, providing insights into accuracy and cost metricsfor images exhibiting varying levels of distortion. Notably,our proposed method, I-SplitEE, demonstrates its remark-able performance by yielding the smallest performance drop(\u2264 5%) and the most substantial cost reduction ( > 65%) incomparison to the final exit. The cost values in the table are--- Page 6 ---computed as the cumulative sum of both computational andoffloading costs over the entire dataset. It is worth notingthat both the \u201dFinal Layer\u201d and \u201dEarly Exit\u201d baselines entailexecuting all computations on the mobile device, resulting ina significant computational cost that impacts the efficiency ofthe edge device. The accuracy loss observed in the \u201dEarlyExit\u201d scenario primarily stems from misclassifications madeby intermediate classifiers, which are subsequently rectifiedin the deeper layers. On the other hand, both \u201dRandom Exit\u201dand \u201dAdaEE\u201d provide an option to offload, but they havefixed splitting layers, preventing dynamic adaptation of thesplitting point. \u201dAdaEE,\u201d however, possesses the advantageof adjusting thresholds based on contextual information.Comparing our method with other baselines, I-SplitEEshowcases a remarkable reduction in cost by efficiently opti-mizing resource utilization on both edge and cloud platforms.The distinct advantage of I-SplitEE lies in its adaptive nature,enabling it to select the optimal splitting layer based on pastsamples. It accounts for a minimal reduction in accuracydue to offloading to the cloud. Overall, I-SplitEE effectivelyoptimizes resource utilization across both mobile devices andcloud infrastructure by balancing the computational as wellas communication costs.VII. C ONCLUSIONWe address the problem of executing the DNNs on edgedevices by considering the resources available on the edge.We propose a method that combines early exits and splitcomputing to reduce the computational cost of inference onedge devices as well as communication costs to the cloud.The developed algorithm I-SplitEE splits the DNN based onthe resources available where the initial part of the DNN isdeployed on the edge device with an exit attached at thelast layer on the edge device. If the sample gains sufficientconfidence on the edge device, it is inferred locally, else itis offloaded to the cloud for inference on the final layer ofDNN. I-SplitEE adapts to changes in the distribution of thetest data when it data arrives in an online and unsupervised.Notably, I-SplitEE has a minimal drop in accuracy even whencost changes making it more robust to different user-specificdevices.Our work could be extended by simultaneously adaptingto the optimal threshold as well as the splitting layer. Also,our method finds the optimal splitting layer based on all thesamples, however, the splitting layer could be learned basedon the difficulty level of the individual samples.REFERENCES[1] K.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n\nTitle: A Comprehensive Review of Spiking Neural Networks: Interpretation, Optimization, Efficiency, and Best Practices\nSummary: Biological neural networks continue to inspire breakthroughs in neural\nnetwork performance.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n\nTitle: A Deep Unsupervised Feature Learning Spiking Neural Network with Binarized Classification Layers for EMNIST Classification using SpykeFlow\nSummary: End user AI is trained on large server farms with data collected from the\nusers. With ever increasing demand for IOT devices, there is a need for deep\nlearning approaches that can be implemented (at the edge) in an energy\nefficient manner. In this work we approach this using spiking neural networks.\nThe unsupervised learning technique of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)\nusing binary activations are used to extract features from spiking input data.\nGradient descent (backpropagation) is used only on the output layer to perform\nthe training for classification. The accuracies obtained for the balanced\nEMNIST data set compare favorably with other approaches.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We\nuse various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency\nand precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results\nbetween the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated\nusing edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and\n7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the\nconventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST\ndataset.\nPublication Date: 2021-10-19\narXiv paper ID: 2110.10217v1\n\nNotes: \nYour previous command was: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification spiking neural networks energy efficiency\n```.

Structured pruning,\nunstructured pruning, and dynamic quantization methods are evaluated to reduce\nmodel size and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The\nexperiments, conducted on cloud-based platforms and edge device, assess the\nperformance of these techniques. Results show significant reductions in model\nsize, with up to 75% reduction achieved using structured pruning techniques.\nAdditionally, dynamic quantization achieves a reduction of up to 95% in the\nnumber of parameters. Fine-tuned models exhibit improved compression\nperformance, indicating the benefits of pre-training in conjunction with\ncompression techniques. Unstructured pruning methods reveal trends in accuracy\nand compression, with limited reductions in computational complexity. The\ncombination of OTOV3 pruning and dynamic quantization further enhances\ncompression performance, resulting 89.7% reduction in size, 95% reduction with\nnumber of parameters and MACs, and 3.8% increase with accuracy. The deployment\nof the final compressed model on edge device demonstrates high accuracy 92.5%\nand low inference time 20 ms, validating the effectiveness of compression\ntechniques for real-world edge computing applications.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-02\narXiv paper ID: 2409.02134v1\n\nTitle: Are Visual Recognition Models Robust to Image Compression?\nSummary: Reducing the data footprint of visual content via image compression is\nessential to reduce storage requirements, but also to reduce the bandwidth and\nlatency requirements for transmission. In particular, the use of compressed\nimages allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual\nrecognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition\nability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,\nfor segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1\nbpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the\nperformance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on\ncompressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For\nexample, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%\nof the original drop in accuracy.\nPublication Date: 2023-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2304.04518v1\n\nTitle: HiRISE: High-Resolution Image Scaling for Edge ML via In-Sensor Compression and Selective ROI\nSummary: With the rise of tiny IoT devices powered by machine learning (ML), many\nresearchers have directed their focus toward compressing models to fit on tiny\nedge devices. Recent works have achieved remarkable success in compressing ML\nmodels for object detection and image classification on microcontrollers with\nsmall memory, e.g., 512kB SRAM. However, there remain many challenges\nprohibiting the deployment of ML systems that require high-resolution images.\nDue to fundamental limits in memory capacity for tiny IoT devices, it may be\nphysically impossible to store large images without external hardware. To this\nend, we propose a high-resolution image scaling system for edge ML, called\nHiRISE, which is equipped with selective region-of-interest (ROI) capability\nleveraging analog in-sensor image scaling. Our methodology not only\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory requirements, but also achieves up to\n17.7x reduction in data transfer and energy consumption.\nPublication Date: 2024-07-23\narXiv paper ID: 2408.03956v1\n\nTitle: A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing\nSummary: Split computing ($\\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep\nlearning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak\nsensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers\nthrough channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on\nsplit computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods\nto multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase\nruntime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head\nsupervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental\nresults show that the multi-task supervised compression model either\noutperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of\npredictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets\nwhile learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our\nmodels reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of\nmobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-02\narXiv paper ID: 2501.01420v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Privacy Preserving Edge Computing Framework for Image Classification\nSummary: In order to extract knowledge from the large data collected by edge devices,\ntraditional cloud based approach that requires data upload may not be feasible\ndue to communication bandwidth limitation as well as privacy and security\nconcerns of end users. To address these challenges, a novel privacy preserving\nedge computing framework is proposed in this paper for image classification.\nSpecifically, autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device\nindividually, then the obtained latent vectors will be transmitted to the edge\nserver for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the\ncommunications overhead and protect the data of the end users. Comparing to\nfederated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework\ndoes not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder\ncan be trained independently at each edge device without any server\ninvolvement. Furthermore, the privacy of the end users' data is protected by\ntransmitting latent vectors without additional cost of encryption. Experimental\nresults provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various\ndesign parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the\nmodel complexity.\nPublication Date: 2020-05-10\narXiv paper ID: 2005.04563v2\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model quantization optimization\n```\nStep #18, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model quantization optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Over-the-Air Federated Edge Learning with Error-Feedback One-Bit Quantization and Power Control\nSummary: Over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) is a communication-efficient\nframework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at\nedge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these\nissues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation\n(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an\nappropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without\nquantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further\nintroduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under\ninstantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power\ncontrol policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed\nscheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in\nimage classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme\nwithout error feedback or optimized power control policy.\nPublication Date: 2023-03-20\narXiv paper ID: 2303.11319v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: A Principled Hierarchical Deep Learning Approach to Joint Image Compression and Classification\nSummary: Among applications of deep learning (DL) involving low cost sensors, remote\nimage classification involves a physical channel that separates edge sensors\nand cloud classifiers. Traditional DL models must be divided between an encoder\nfor the sensor and the decoder + classifier at the edge server. An important\nchallenge is to effectively train such distributed models when the connecting\nchannels have limited rate/capacity. Our goal is to optimize DL models such\nthat the encoder latent requires low channel bandwidth while still delivers\nfeature information for high classification accuracy. This work proposes a\nthree-step joint learning strategy to guide encoders to extract features that\nare compact, discriminative, and amenable to common\naugmentations/transformations. We optimize latent dimension through an initial\nscreening phase before end-to-end (E2E) training. To obtain an adjustable bit\nrate via a single pre-deployed encoder, we apply entropy-based quantization\nand/or manual truncation on the latent representations. Tests show that our\nproposed method achieves accuracy improvement of up to 1.5% on CIFAR-10 and 3%\non CIFAR-100 over conventional E2E cross-entropy training.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-30\narXiv paper ID: 2310.19675v1\n\nTitle: Differentiable Search for Finding Optimal Quantization Strategy\nSummary: To accelerate and compress deep neural networks (DNNs), many network\nquantization algorithms have been proposed. Although the quantization strategy\nof any algorithm from the state-of-the-arts may outperform others in some\nnetwork architectures, it is hard to prove the strategy is always better than\nothers, and even cannot judge that the strategy is always the best choice for\nall layers in a network. In other words, existing quantization algorithms are\nsuboptimal as they ignore the different characteristics of different layers and\nquantize all layers by a uniform quantization strategy. To solve the issue, in\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable quantization strategy search (DQSS) to\nassign optimal quantization strategy for individual layer by taking advantages\nof the benefits of different quantization algorithms. Specifically, we\nformulate DQSS as a differentiable neural architecture search problem and adopt\nan efficient convolution to efficiently explore the mixed quantization\nstrategies from a global perspective by gradient-based optimization. We conduct\nDQSS for post-training quantization to enable their performance to be\ncomparable with that in full precision models. We also employ DQSS in\nquantization-aware training for further validating the effectiveness of DQSS.\nTo circumvent the expensive optimization cost when employing DQSS in\nquantization-aware training, we update the hyper-parameters and the network\nparameters in a single forward-backward pass. Besides, we adjust the\noptimization process to avoid the potential under-fitting problem.\nComprehensive experiments on high level computer vision task, i.e., image\nclassification, and low level computer vision task, i.e., image\nsuper-resolution, with various network architectures show that DQSS could\noutperform the state-of-the-arts.\nPublication Date: 2024-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2404.08010v2\n\nTitle: Efficient Graph Cut Optimization for Full CRFs with Quantized Edges\nSummary: Fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Fields (Full-CRF) with Gaussian\nedge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.\nHowever, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work\ndevelops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,\nwhich is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We\npropose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs\nwith quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image\ninto superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels\ndepends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF\nis an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as\nsuperpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an\nintuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.\nFor efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an\napproximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller\ndomain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion\nmoves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly\nlower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the\neffectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.\nPublication Date: 2018-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 1809.04995v1\n, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification model pruning optimization\n```\nStep #19, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model pruning optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Multi-Dimensional Pruning: Joint Channel, Layer and Block Pruning with Latency Constraint\nSummary: As we push the boundaries of performance in various vision tasks, the models\ngrow in size correspondingly. To keep up with this growth, we need very\naggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge\ndevices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and\nstruggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across\nchannels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop\na latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency\nvariations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal\nlatency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a\nMixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal\npruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning\nratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP\nwith a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101\nim/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning\nStreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP\n(0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-17\narXiv paper ID: 2406.12079v1\n\nTitle: Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning: A general framework for hardware-constrained pruning at different granularities\nSummary: Unstructured neural network pruning algorithms have achieved impressive\ncompression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic\nmetrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within\na layer.\nPublication Date: 2021-05-26\narXiv paper ID: 2105.12686v1\n\nTitle: Automated Tomato Maturity Estimation Using an Optimized Residual Model with Pruning and Quantization Techniques\nSummary: Tomato maturity plays a pivotal role in optimizing harvest timing and\nensuring product quality, but current methods struggle to achieve high accuracy\nalong computational efficiency simultaneously. Existing deep learning\napproaches, while accurate, are often too computationally demanding for\npractical use in resource-constrained agricultural settings. In contrast,\nsimpler techniques fail to capture the nuanced features needed for precise\nclassification. This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato\nclassification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through\ntransfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to\naddress the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling\nreal-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were\ndeployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity\nclassification. The quantized model achieved an accuracy of 97.81%, with an\naverage classification time of 0.000975 seconds per image. The pruned and\nauto-tuned model also demonstrated significant improvements in deployment\nmetrics, further highlighting the benefits of optimization techniques. These\nresults underscore the potential for a balanced solution that meets the\naccuracy and efficiency demands of modern agricultural production, paving the\nway for practical, real-world deployment in resource-limited environments.\nPublication Date: 2025-03-13\narXiv paper ID: 2503.10940v1\n\nTitle: Asymptotic Soft Filter Pruning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\nSummary: Deeper and wider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior\nperformance but bring expensive computation cost. Accelerating such\nover-parameterized neural network has received increased attention. A typical\npruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning, and\nretraining. Prevailing approaches fix the pruned filters to zero during\nretraining, and thus significantly reduce the optimization space. Besides, they\ndirectly prune a large number of filters at first, which would cause\nunrecoverable information loss. To solve these problems, we propose an\nAsymptotic Soft Filter Pruning (ASFP) method to accelerate the inference\nprocedure of the deep neural networks. First, we update the pruned filters\nduring the retraining stage. As a result, the optimization space of the pruned\nmodel would not be reduced but be the same as that of the original model. In\nthis way, the model has enough capacity to learn from the training data.\nSecond, we prune the network asymptotically. We prune few filters at first and\nasymptotically prune more filters during the training procedure. With\nasymptotic pruning, the information of the training set would be gradually\nconcentrated in the remaining filters, so the subsequent training and pruning\nprocess would be stable. Experiments show the effectiveness of our ASFP on\nimage classification benchmarks. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, our ASFP reduces more\nthan 40% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.14% top-5 accuracy degradation, which\nis higher than the soft filter pruning (SFP) by 8%.\nPublication Date: 2018-08-22\narXiv paper ID: 1808.07471v4\n\nTitle: Towards Sparsification of Graph Neural Networks\nSummary: As real-world graphs expand in size, larger GNN models with billions of\nparameters are deployed. High parameter count in such models makes training and\ninference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and\nmemory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes\nand edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model\ncompression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has\nbeen mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize\ntwo state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2)\nsparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate\nand compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training\nsparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results\nshow that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link\nprediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for\nnode classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7\nFLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy\nperformance under extreme model sparsity.\nPublication Date: 2022-09-11\narXiv paper ID: 2209.04766v3\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2406.12079v1\n```\nStep #21, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification model distillation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Convex Distillation: Efficient Compression of Deep Networks via Convex Optimization\nSummary: Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-09\narXiv paper ID: 2410.06567v1\n\nTitle: Optimizing Parking Space Classification: Distilling Ensembles into Lightweight Classifiers\nSummary: When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city\napplications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be\nsent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging\nfor the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require\ntransmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware\ninfrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based\nparking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of\nclassifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into\nlightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on\nedge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through\npseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to\nfine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the\nStudent models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models,\nachieved an average accuracy of 96.6% on the target test datasets, surpassing\nthe Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3%.\nPublication Date: 2024-10-07\narXiv paper ID: 2410.14705v1\n\nTitle: Region-aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image-to-Image Translation\nSummary: Recent progress in image-to-image translation has witnessed the success of\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs usually contain a huge\nnumber of parameters, which lead to intolerant memory and computation\nconsumption and limit their deployment on edge devices. To address this issue,\nknowledge distillation is proposed to transfer the knowledge from a cumbersome\nteacher model to an efficient student model. However, most previous knowledge\ndistillation methods are designed for image classification and lead to limited\nperformance in image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose\nRegion-aware Knowledge Distillation ReKo to compress image-to-image translation\nmodels. Firstly, ReKo adaptively finds the crucial regions in the images with\nan attention module. Then, patch-wise contrastive learning is adopted to\nmaximize the mutual information between students and teachers in these crucial\nregions. Experiments with eight comparison methods on nine datasets demonstrate\nthe substantial effectiveness of ReKo on both paired and unpaired\nimage-to-image translation. For instance, our 7.08X compressed and 6.80X\naccelerated CycleGAN student outperforms its teacher by 1.33 and 1.04 FID\nscores on Horse to Zebra and Zebra to Horse, respectively. Codes will be\nreleased on GitHub.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-25\narXiv paper ID: 2205.12451v1\n\nTitle: Edge AI-Enabled Chicken Health Detection Based on Enhanced FCOS-Lite and Knowledge Distillation\nSummary: The utilization of AIoT technology has become a crucial trend in modern\npoultry management, offering the potential to optimize farming operations and\nreduce human workloads. This paper presents a real-time and compact edge-AI\nenabled detector designed to identify chickens and their healthy statuses using\nframes captured by a lightweight and intelligent camera equipped with an\nedge-AI enabled CMOS sensor. To ensure efficient deployment of the proposed\ncompact detector within the memory-constrained edge-AI enabled CMOS sensor, we\nemploy a FCOS-Lite detector leveraging MobileNet as the backbone. To mitigate\nthe issue of reduced accuracy in compact edge-AI detectors without incurring\nadditional inference costs, we propose a gradient weighting loss function as\nclassification loss and introduce CIOU loss function as localization loss.\nAdditionally, we propose a knowledge distillation scheme to transfer valuable\ninformation from a large teacher detector to the proposed FCOS-Lite detector,\nthereby enhancing its performance while preserving a compact model size.\nExperimental results demonstrate the proposed edge-AI enabled detector achieves\ncommendable performance metrics, including a mean average precision (mAP) of\n95.1$\\%$ and an F1-score of 94.2$\\%$, etc. Notably, the proposed detector can\nbe efficiently deployed and operates at a speed exceeding 20 FPS on the edge-AI\nenabled CMOS sensor, achieved through int8 quantization.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2410.06567v1\n```\nStep #23, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2410.06567v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search\n```\nStep #24, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification hardware-aware neural architecture search, here was the response\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras.

However, deep learning techniques\nlike computer vision and natural language processing can be computationally\nexpensive and memory-intensive. Creating manual architectures specialized for\neach device is infeasible due to their varying memory and computational\nconstraints. To address these concerns, we automate the construction of\ntask-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints\nthrough Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled\nmethod of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device\nconstraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates\nweight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time.\nBased on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures\nfor similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on\nvarious image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImagenet-1k. Experiments with search spaces -- DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 show the\ngeneralization capabilities of DCA-NAS. On further evaluating our approach on\nHardware-NAS-Bench, device-specific architectures with low inference latency\nand state-of-the-art performance were discovered.\nPublication Date: 2023-07-10\narXiv paper ID: 2307.04443v1\n\nTitle: AutoShrink: A Topology-aware NAS for Discovering Efficient Neural Architecture\nSummary: Resource is an important constraint when deploying Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on mobile and edge devices. Existing works commonly adopt the cell-based\nsearch approach, which limits the flexibility of network patterns in learned\ncell structures. Moreover, due to the topology-agnostic nature of existing\nworks, including both cell-based and node-based approaches, the search process\nis time consuming and the performance of found architecture may be sub-optimal.\nTo address these problems, we propose AutoShrink, a topology-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search(NAS) for searching efficient building blocks of neural\narchitectures. Our method is node-based and thus can learn flexible network\npatterns in cell structures within a topological search space. Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs) are used to abstract DNN architectures and progressively optimize\nthe cell structure through edge shrinking. As the search space intrinsically\nreduces as the edges are progressively shrunk, AutoShrink explores more\nflexible search space with even less search time. We evaluate AutoShrink on\nimage classification and language tasks by crafting ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN\nmodels. ShrinkCNN is able to achieve up to 48% parameter reduction and save 34%\nMultiply-Accumulates (MACs) on ImageNet-1K with comparable accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Specifically, both ShrinkCNN and ShrinkRNN are\ncrafted within 1.5 GPU hours, which is 7.2x and 6.7x faster than the crafting\ntime of SOTA CNN and RNN models, respectively.\nPublication Date: 2019-11-21\narXiv paper ID: 1911.09251v1\n\nTitle: Neural Architecture Search Over a Graph Search Space\nSummary: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enabled the discovery of state-of-the-art\narchitectures in many domains. However, the success of NAS depends on the\ndefinition of the search space. Current search spaces are defined as a static\nsequence of decisions and a set of available actions for each decision. Each\npossible sequence of actions defines an architecture. We propose a more\nexpressive class of search space: directed graphs. In our formalism, each\ndecision is a vertex and each action is an edge. This allows us to model\niterative and branching architecture design decisions. We demonstrate in\nsimulation, and on image classification experiments, basic iterative and\nbranching search structures, and show that the graph representation improves\nsample efficiency.\nPublication Date: 2018-12-27\narXiv paper ID: 1812.10666v2\n\nTitle: Discretization-Aware Architecture Search\nSummary: The search cost of neural architecture search (NAS) has been largely reduced\nby weight-sharing methods. These methods optimize a super-network with all\npossible edges and operations, and determine the optimal sub-network by\ndiscretization, \\textit{i.e.}, pruning off weak candidates. The discretization\nprocess, performed on either operations or edges, incurs significant inaccuracy\nand thus the quality of the final architecture is not guaranteed. This paper\npresents discretization-aware architecture search (DA\\textsuperscript{2}S),\nwith the core idea being adding a loss term to push the super-network towards\nthe configuration of desired topology, so that the accuracy loss brought by\ndiscretization is largely alleviated.

To improve robustness of DNNs, they must be able to update themselves to\nenhance their prediction accuracy. This adaptation at the resource-constrained\nedge is challenging as: (i) new labeled data may not be present; (ii)\nadaptation needs to be on device as connections to cloud may not be available;\nand (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and\nenergy-efficient. Recently, lightweight prediction-time unsupervised DNN\nadaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of\nthe models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.\nThis paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of\nsuch techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge\ndevices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In\nparticular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with\ncorruptions, three robust DNNs (ResNeXt, Wide-ResNet, ResNet-18), two BN\nadaptation algorithms (one that updates normalization statistics and the other\nthat also optimizes transformation parameters), and three edge devices (FPGA,\nRaspberry-Pi, and Nvidia Xavier NX). We find that the approach that only\nupdates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,\nto be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,\nthe adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results\nstrongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient\non-device DNN adaptation.\nPublication Date: 2022-03-21\narXiv paper ID: 2203.11295v1\n\nTitle: Benchmarking Deep Learning Models on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for Real-Time Systems: An Empirical Investigation\nSummary: The proliferation of complex deep learning (DL) models has revolutionized\nvarious applications, including computer vision-based solutions, prompting\ntheir integration into real-time systems. However, the resource-intensive\nnature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational\npower and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work\nempirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze\ntheir functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson\nNano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their\ninference speed for image classification and video action detection. The\nexperimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11%\nspeed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only\nemphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental\nsustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the\npivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of\nAI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also\nserves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to\nefficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption\nand carbon footprint.\nPublication Date: 2024-06-25\narXiv paper ID: 2406.17749v1\n\nTitle: Optimized spiking neurons classify images with high accuracy through temporal coding with two spikes\nSummary: Spike-based neuromorphic hardware promises to reduce the energy consumption\nof image classification and other deep learning applications, particularly on\nmobile phones or other edge devices. However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency\nand throughput of the resulting spiking networks.\nPublication Date: 2020-01-31\narXiv paper ID: 2002.00860v4\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2211.09897v1\n```\nStep #29, Phase: literature review, Feedback: Successfully added paper 2211.09897v1, Your response: ```SUMMARY\nedge image classification dynamic computation optimization\n```\nStep #30, Phase: literature review, Feedback: You requested arXiv papers related to the query edge image classification dynamic computation optimization, here was the response\nTitle: Immiscible Color Flows in Optimal Transport Networks for Image Classification\nSummary: In classification tasks, it is crucial to meaningfully exploit the\ninformation contained in data. While much of the work in addressing these tasks\nis devoted to building complex algorithmic infrastructures to process inputs in\na black-box fashion, less is known about how to exploit the various facets of\nthe data, before inputting this into an algorithm. Here, we focus on this\nlatter perspective, by proposing a physics-inspired dynamical system that\nadapts Optimal Transport principles to effectively leverage color distributions\nof images. Our dynamics regulates immiscible fluxes of colors traveling on a\nnetwork built from images. Instead of aggregating colors together, it treats\nthem as different commodities that interact with a shared capacity on edges.\nThe resulting optimal flows can then be fed into standard classifiers to\ndistinguish images in different classes. We show how our method can outperform\ncompeting approaches on image classification tasks in datasets where color\ninformation matters.\nPublication Date: 2022-05-04\narXiv paper ID: 2205.02938v2\n\nTitle: Pushing Joint Image Denoising and Classification to the Edge\nSummary: In this paper, we jointly combine image classification and image denoising,\naiming to enhance human perception of noisy images captured by edge devices,\nlike low-light security cameras. In such settings, it is important to retain\nthe ability of humans to verify the automatic classification decision and thus\njointly denoise the image to enhance human perception. Since edge devices have\nlittle computational power, we explicitly optimize for efficiency by proposing\na novel architecture that integrates the two tasks. Additionally, we alter a\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) method, which searches for classifiers to\nsearch for the integrated model while optimizing for a target latency,\nclassification accuracy, and denoising performance. The NAS architectures\noutperform our manually designed alternatives in both denoising and\nclassification, offering a significant improvement to human perception. Our\napproach empowers users to construct architectures tailored to domains like\nmedical imaging, surveillance systems, and industrial inspections.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-13\narXiv paper ID: 2409.08943v1\n\nTitle: An Efficient Pattern Mining Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm with Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)\nSummary: Automation of feature analysis in the dynamic image frame dataset deals with\ncomplexity of intensity mapping with normal and abnormal class. The\nthreshold-based data clustering and feature analysis requires iterative model\nto learn the component of image frame in multi-pattern for different image\nframe data type. This paper proposed a novel model of feature analysis method\nwith the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature\nvectors that are optimized by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm.\nInitially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the\nimage frame that reduce the noise and apply smoothening on it. From that, the\nedge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image\nframe. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated\nlearning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image\nframe pixels. Features of the filtered image frame was analyzed in different\npattern of feature extraction model based on the convoluted model of wavelet\ntransformation method. These features represent the different class of image\nframe in spatial and textural pattern of it. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier supports to analyze the features and classify the action label for\nthe image frame dataset. This process enhances the classification with minimum\nnumber of training dataset. The performance of this proposed method can be\nvalidated by comparing with traditional state-of-art methods.\nPublication Date: 2022-04-10\narXiv paper ID: 2204.04704v1\n\nTitle: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading\nSummary: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and\nrequire immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as\nautonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive\nnature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with\ndesigning edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems\nand techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered\nedge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing.\nCentral to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which\nenables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading\nmore complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To\nfurther enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive\noffloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the\noptimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The\nassociated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original\nnon-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural\nnetwork classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification\naccuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to\nexisting edge-inference approaches.\nPublication Date: 2025-01-01\narXiv paper ID: 2501.02001v1\n\nTitle: Efficient Feature Compression for Edge-Cloud Systems\nSummary: Optimizing computation in an edge-cloud system is an important yet\nchallenging problem.

Task-oriented edge\ncomputing addresses this by shifting data analysis to the edge. However,\nlimited computational power of edge devices poses challenges for executing\nvisual tasks. Existing methods struggle to balance high model performance with\nlow resource consumption; lightweight neural networks often underperform, while\ndevice-specific models designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) fail to\nadapt to heterogeneous devices. For these issues, we propose a novel co-design\nframework to optimize neural network architecture and deployment strategies\nduring inference for high-throughput. Specifically, it implements a dynamic\nmodel structure based on re-parameterization, coupled with a Roofline-based\nmodel partitioning strategy to enhance the computational performance of edge\ndevices. We also employ a multi-objective co-optimization approach to balance\nthroughput and accuracy. Additionally, we derive mathematical consistency and\nconvergence of partitioned models. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in throughput (12.05\\% on MNIST, 18.83\\% on ImageNet) and superior\nclassification accuracy compared to baseline algorithms. Our method\nconsistently achieves stable performance across different devices, underscoring\nits adaptability.

Data transmissions from devices to\nservers are often over local wireless networks whose bandwidth is not just\nlimited but, more importantly, variable. Furthermore, in cyber-physical systems\ninteracting with the physical environment, image offloading is also commonly\nsubject to timing constraints. It is, therefore, important to develop an\nadaptive approach that maximizes the inference performance of ML applications\nunder timing constraints and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In this\npaper, we use image classification as our target application and propose\nprogressive neural compression (PNC) as an efficient solution to this problem.\nAlthough neural compression has been used to compress images for different ML\napplications, existing solutions often produce fixed-size outputs that are\nunsuitable for timing-constrained offloading over variable bandwidth. To\naddress this limitation, we train a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that\noptimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a\ncompression solution that produces features ordered according to their\nimportance to inference performance. Features are then transmitted in that\norder based on available bandwidth, with classification ultimately performed\nusing the (sub)set of features received by the deadline. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of PNC over state-of-the-art neural compression approaches and\ntraditional compression methods on a testbed comprising an IoT device and an\nedge server connected over a wireless network with varying bandwidth.\nPublication Date: 2023-10-08\narXiv paper ID: 2310.05306v1\n\nTitle: Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies\nSummary: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and\npromising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification,\nobject detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as\nsequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their\nhigh computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges\nfor deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\nlimitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and\nhardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review\nthat systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in\naccuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains\nlacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy,\nefficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging\nresearch directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), application-specific integrated circuit\n(ASICs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire\nfurther research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient\ndeployment on edge devices.\nPublication Date: 2025-02-26\narXiv paper ID: 2503.02891v3\n\nTitle: Hybrid Knowledge Transfer through Attention and Logit Distillation for On-Device Vision Systems in Agricultural IoT\nSummary: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a\nserious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nwith the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU\nand 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric\nvalidation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching\nattention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over\nstandalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over\nMobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time,\nenergy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how\nwe can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models\nwill be made available for replication after acceptance.\nPublication Date: 2025-04-21\narXiv paper ID: 2504.16128v1\n, Your response: ```FULL_TEXT\n2401.10541v1\n```\nStep #32, Phase: literature review, Feedback: 3\n--- Page 1 ---I-SplitEE: Image classification in Split ComputingDNNs with Early ExitsDivya J.

I NTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)has undergone substantial expansion, leading to remarkableperformance achievements [1], especially for computer visiontasks such as image classification [2]. This increased scalehas increased computational demands, rendering their deploy-ment on resource-constrained platforms like mobile and edgedevices. To mitigate the computational challenges associatedwith deploying DNNs on these devices, various strategieshave been introduced. These include approaches like SplitComputing, Early Exits, and offloading to cloud [3].Split Computing. Edge devices, often constrained by limitedprocessing capabilities, can opt to offload their data to thecloud, which boasts superior computational power. This ap-proach involves running the full-fledged Deep Neural Network(DNN) in the cloud, subsequently returning the inferencesto the edge device. However, this offloading of data to thecloud incurs latency due to communication delays between theedge device and the cloud. To harness the combined resourcesavailable on both mobile devices and the cloud, a strategyknown as \u201dsplit computing\u201d has been introduced. In splitcomputing, the DNN is bifurcated into two segments: a subsetof initial layers is deployed on the edge device, while theremaining layers are hosted in the cloud. The portion deployedon the edge device serves as an encoder for processinginput images, reducing their size and, consequently, mitigatinglatency costs. This hybrid approach facilitates edge-cloud co-inference. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that in splitcomputing, all samples still need to be inferred at the finallayer on the cloud, which, while reducing the computationalburden on edge devices, maintains significant communicationcosts, as every sample is offloaded [3].Early Exits (EE-DNNs). Several previous methods, includingBranchyNet [4], SPINN [5], and LGViT [6], enable the clas-sification of input images by adding classifiers at intermediatelayers within DNNs. In these early exit DNNs, the decisionto classify the image at an intermediate stage is contingenton the confidence of the prediction surpassing a predefinedthreshold. Exiting the network at its early layers demandsless computational resources but may lead to less precisepredictions. Conversely, deeper exits offer greater precisionbut at the cost of higher computational demands. Therefore,determining the best exit point within the network is importantto model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.In our approach, we introduce a hybrid strategy that com-bines both split computing and early exits to optimize resourceusage on both edge devices and the cloud. We define the\u201dsplitting layer\u201d as the final layer on the edge device. At thislayer, we attach an exit point for making inferences locallyon the edge device. Before an input image is transferred tothe cloud, it undergoes classification on the edge device. Ifthe prediction confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold,the process is terminated, and the image is classified on theedge. In cases where the confidence falls below the threshold,the image is offloaded to the cloud for further processing.While previous methods [7], [8] traditionally employ a fixedsplitting layer on the edge device, our approach advocates forthe adaptive selection of the splitting layer. This adaptability isparticularly crucial in real-world scenarios where input imagesoften exhibit various distortions [9]. For instance, edge devicesfrequently encounter noisy or blurred images, with differentlevels of distortion. Pacheco et al. [10] empirically illustratethe influence of noise on confidence values in images. Thedistortion in images changes the latent distribution of thedataset and significantly impacts the confidence values andinference results [7]. During inference, the data arrives in anonline (sequential order) fashion and the ground truth valuesfor the image sample are not available. Hence the questionthen arises, how to adaptively choose the optimal splittinglayer to model the accuracy-efficiency trade-off when theunderlying latent distribution of incoming data changes?To address the challenge of selecting an optimal split-arXiv:2401.10541v1  [cs.LG]  19 Jan 2024--- Page 2 ---L1 L2b1LibjLNEdge Device OffloadFig. 1. Split computing combined with early exits, where the DNN is splitinto two parts with an additional advantage of inference on mobile device.ting layer when the test data has a different distribution ascompared to the dataset used for training, we introduce anonline learning algorithm called I-SplitEE. This algorithmleverages the Multi-Armed Bandit framework [11], utilizingthe confidence in prediction as a surrogate for predictionaccuracy at the exit point. The computational cost is the costof running the DNN on edge devices, while the offloadingcost is the cost of communication delays between edge andcloud. The primary objective is to maximize prediction con-fidence while minimizing computational and offloading costs.I-SplitEE dynamically determines the optimal splitting layerfor an incoming sample based on past observations from thedataset with a given latent data distribution. I-SplitEE modelcould be adapted to different edge devices and communicationnetworks as well using user-specific inputs.For our backbone model, we adopt the lightweight Mo-bileNet V2 [12] model. This choice is an ideal testbed forour algorithm, given its efficiency and competitive accuracycompared to state-of-the-art models. We conduct experimentsunder varying levels of noise (distortion) in the dataset, asdetailed in Section V. Our experimental results on Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets demonstrate that the optimalsplitting layer differs as there are changes in the distributionof data. Specifically, I-SplitEE achieves a significant reductionin the cost (> 55%) with only a minimal drop in performance(\u2264 5%) when compared to the scenario where all samples areprocessed at the final layer.Our key contributions encompass: 1) We integrate splitcomputing and early exiting to enable early inferences for\u201deasy\u201d samples on edge devices. 2) We develop an onlinelearning algorithm I-SplitEE to dynamically select the optimalsplitting layer based on context in an online and unsupervisedmanner. 3) I-SplitEE optimizes the resource utilization acrossedge devices and the cloud. 4) We experimentally validatethat I-SplitEE minimizes performance degradation while sig-nificantly reducing costs compared to the final exit scenario.II. R ELATED WORKSIn this section, we discuss the previous works on Splitcomputing and Early Exit to use DNNs on mobile devices.Split computing for DNNs. Neurosurgeon, as introduced in[15], explores strategies for optimizing the splitting of DNNsbased on the cost considerations associated with selectinga specific splitting layer. In a similar vein, BottleNet [16]incorporates a bottleneck mechanism within split computing.This approach entails deploying a segment of the DNN onan edge device to encode the input sample into a morecompact representation before transmitting it to the cloud forfurther processing. Various training methodologies have beenproposed for training the encoder situated on the edge device.Notably, BottleNet++ employs cross-entropy-based trainingapproaches in the context of split computing.Early-Exit DNNs. Early-exit DNNs have found applicationsacross diverse tasks. In the context of image classification,BranchyNet [4] and several preceding studies utilize clas-sification entropy metrics at different intermediate layers todetermine whether early inference can be made with sufficientconfidence. Approaches like SPINN [5] incorporate earlyexits into DNN architectures, primarily aimed at handlingservice disruptions. Beyond image classification, early exitshave found relevance in various domains, spanning naturallanguage processing tasks (NLP) [17], [18].DNNs on mobile device. AdaEE [7] employs a combina-tion of early-exit DNNs and DNN partitioning to facilitateoffloading data from mobile devices using early-exit DNNs.LEE (Learning Early Exit) [19], DEE (Dynamic Early exit)[20] and UEE-UCB (Unsupervised early exits using UpperConfidence Bound) [21] leverage the multi-armed banditframework to determine optimal exit points. However, theylack the offloading and primarily focus on performing opera-tions on edge devices. LEE and DEE are specifically designedfor efficient edge device inference, particularly in cases ofservice disruptions, employing utility functions that requireaccess to ground-truth labels. Notably, UEE-UCB specializesin learning the optimal exit strategy for the ElasticBERT [18]backbone, primarily tailored for text classification tasks.Our approach distinguishes itself from prior methods inseveral key aspects. 1) We consider not only accuracy but alsocomputational and communication costs when determining theoptimal splitting layer. 2) Our method operates in an onlineand unsupervised setup, offering a novel perspective. 3) Weleverage contextual information, such as confidence scores,to dynamically determine the splitting layer for each sampleduring edge device processing.III. P ROBLEM SETUPIn our scenario, we train a deep neural network (DNN)consisting of L layers. We introduce exit points into thisbackbone after specific layers. We denote the set of layers as[L] = {1, 2, . . . , L}. The set of target classes for classificationis denoted as C. For a given image, x, and an exit attachedto layer i, we define \u02c6Pi(c) as the estimated probability that xbelongs to class c, where c belongs to C. The confidence in theestimated probability class, defined as Ci = maxc\u2208C \u02c6Pi(c), isthe maximum among these estimated probabilities.The DNN processes the image x, and the point at whichthe DNN splits can occur at any layer i where exit is attached,where the layers 1 through i reside on the edge device, andthe remaining layers i + 1 through L are processed on the--- Page 3 ---cloud. In our setup, each image requires two-stage decisions:1) Determining the optimal splitting point in the DNN, and2) Deciding whether to exit at the chosen splitting layer oroffload the task. Notably, the choice of the splitting layer relieson the collective context rather than individual samples. Thechoice to exit or offload depends on individual samples andfollows this process: When the DNN splits at the ith layer, wecalculate Ci(x) and compare it with a predefined threshold,denoted as \u03b1. If the confidence Ci(x) \u2265 \u03b1, the image sampleis inferred locally on the edge device and does not requireoffloading. Otherwise, it is offloaded to the cloud for inferenceat the final layer incurring communication costs.The cost of using the DNN up to layer i encompasses thecomputational cost of processing the image sample up to thatlayer on the edge and performing inference. We represent thecomputational cost associated with splitting at the ith layer as\u03b3i, where \u03b3i is proportional to the layer depth i. Additionally,we introduce the cost of offloading from the edge deviceto the cloud, denoted as o, which depends on factors liketransmission type (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi). We define thereward function for splitting at layer i \u2208 [L] asr(i) = Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i if Ci \u2265 \u03b1 or i = LCL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o) otherwise, (1)where \xb5 serves as a conversion factor, enabling us to representthe cost in terms of confidence. The user-defined value of \xb5reflects the user\u2019s preference and captures the balance betweenaccuracy and cost.The reward function\u2019s interpretation is as follows: when theDNN generates a confident prediction at the splitting layer,the reward is calculated as the confidence at the splittinglayer minus the cost associated with processing the sampleup to the ith layer and performing inference. In the eventof lower confidence, the sample is offloaded to the cloud,incurring offloading costs and inferring at the final layer,with the confidence of CL. If i is equal to L, the sampleis processed entirely on the edge device, eliminating the needfor offloading. For any splitting layer i \u2208 [L], the expectedreward can be expressed asE[r(i)] = E[Ci \u2212 \xb5\u03b3i|Ci \u2265 \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci \u2265 \u03b1]+ E[CL \u2212 \xb5(\u03b3i + o)|Ci < \u03b1] \xb7 P[Ci < \u03b1] (2)and for the last layer L, it is a constant given as E(r(L)) =CL \u2212 \xb5\u03b3L. The goal is to find the optimal splitting layer i\u2217defined as i\u2217 = arg maxi\u2208[L] E[r(i)].Recall (section I) that the problem of choosing optimalthresholds is in an online and unsupervised setup. In thecontext of online learning problems, the Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) [11] setup plays a pivotal role in addressing challengesrelated to dynamic decision-making. Hence, we employ anMAB framework to find the optimal splitting layer based onuser-specific arguments. In this framework, we establish ouraction set as the set of layer indices where exits are attachedin the DNN denoted as E, where each choice corresponds tosplitting the DNN at an exit point. In MAB terminology, thesechoices are referred to as \u201darms.\u201d Within this framework, wedevise a policy denoted as \u03c0 that selects arm it at each timestep t based on prior observations. We define the cumulativeregret of policy \u03c0 over T rounds asR(\u03c0, T) =TXt=1E[r(i\u2217) \u2212 r(it)] (3)where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in thearm selection caused by previous samples. A policy \u03c0\u2217 is saidto be sub-linear if the average cumulative regret vanishes, i.e.R(\u03c0\u2217, T)/T \u2192 0.IV. A LGORITHMIn this section, we develop an algorithm named I-SplitEE.The algorithm is based on the \u2019optimism in the face of un-certainty principle\u2019 and utilizes the upper confidence bounds.Algorithm 1 I-SplitEE1: Input: \u03b1 (threshold), \u03b2\u2265 1, E, \u03b3i \u2200i \u2208 E, o2: Initialize: Q(i) \u2190 0, N(i) \u2190 0.3: Initialize by playing each arm once.4: for t = |E| + 1, |E| + 2, . . .do5: Observe an instance xt6: it \u2190 arg maxi\u2208EQ(i) + \u03b2qln(t)N(i)7: Pass xt till layer it, use threshold \u03b1 and observe Cit8: if Cit \u2265 \u03b1 then9: Infer at layer it and exit10: rt(it) \u2190 Cit (xt) \u2212 \xb5\u03b3it , Nt(it) \u2190 Nt\u22121(it) + 111: Qt(it) \u2190 Ptj=1 rj(k)1 {k=it}/Nt(it)12: else13: Offload to the last layer.

The pseudo-code ofthe algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The working of thealgorithm could be explained as follows: It plays each armonce to obtain rewards Q(i) and counters N(i) for each layerwith an attached exit. After observing each arm once, it playsan arm it that maximizes the UCB index (line 6) in succeedingrounds. UCB index comprises the weighted sum of empiricalaverages of rewards Q(i) and the confidence bonuses. Thesample is then processed till the splitting layer it and if theconfidence is above the threshold \u03b1, the sample exits theDNN; else the sample is offloaded to the cloud with additionalcost o.From the analysis of UCB1 [22], one can easily verify thatI-SplitEE achieves a sub-linear regret.

E XPERIMENTSIn this section, we provide all the experimental details ofthe paper. There are two key phases in our experimentalsetup. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SplitEE-5DE5/README.md.1) Training the backbone: To evaluate I-SplitEE, wetrain the MobileNet V2 model with 6 task-specific exits atintermediate points and the final exit. The placement of exitsis strategically chosen as described in some previous works[7], [23]. The dataset used for training is the Caltech-256[13] and Cifar-10 [14] datasets. We closely follow the trainingprocedure as described in the paper [7], [19]. The Caltech-256dataset contains undistorted images of objects such as bikes,bears, camels etc. The dataset has a total of 257 differentclasses. The Cifar-10 dataset consists of 10 classes and alsohas a classification task. For the training of the backbone, wesplit the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation andremaining as the test set. Note that after this step no traininghappens. Except in table II, all the given results are from theCaltech-256 dataset due to space constraints.2) Unsupervised learning of Splitting layer based onunderlying distribution: The change in distribution can bedefined by multiple environmental effects, however, we focuson the change as image distortion. Following the training ofthe DNN with attached exits, we apply Gaussian noise asimage distortion on each image from the test set. Gaussiannoise occurs when the camera goes out of focus or the imageis from a foggy environment. To make an image noisy, weadd Gaussian noise to an image with zero mean and standarddeviation \u03c3 to an undistorted image. More standard deviationadds more noise to an image. We vary the standard deviationas \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}.After adding the noise to the image we employ I-SplitEEto find the optimal splitting layer based on the change indistortion present in the image. The predefined threshold islearned on the validation set of the model and is set to 0.6 forCaltech and 0.9 for Cifar-10 as learned by the model. We alsohave two types of costs: 1) Computational cost: As explainedin section III, the computational cost is directly proportionalto the number of layers being processed on the edge device i.e.\u03b3i = \u03bbi where \u03bb is the computational cost for a single layer.\u03bb is user-defined and depends on the processing power ofthe user\u2019s device. We experimented with different processingcost values but due to space constraints, the results are notprovided. However, we set \u03bb = 0 .1 thus normalizing thecost for direct comparison. 2) Offloading cost is also user-defined and depends on the communication network used (e.g.3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi). Hence, we experiment with differentoffloading costs from the set o \u2208 {0.2, 0.4, . . . ,1.0} and show(see subsection V-C) that I-SplitEE gets better results fromother baselines making it robust to different communicationnetworks. For the main results in table I, we fix the offloadingcost as o = 1.0 which is the worst-case scenario. More detailson how to compute the offloading cost can be found in [24].We run all the experiments 10 times and average theresults. The action set is the set of attached exits A ={3, 6, . . .18, 20}. We set the trade-off factor \xb5 = 1 whichcould be varied based on the user\u2019s preferences for accuracyand cost. Smaller values of \xb5 will provide accurate resultsbut with higher costs and vice versa. All the experiments areperformed on a single NVIDIA RTX 2070 GPU. The trainingrequires \u223c 10 hours of GPU runtime for Caltech-256 and \u223c 7hours for Cifar-10 with all the exits. Learning of the optimalsplitting layer could be executed quickly using the CPU.--- Page 5 ---TABLE IIN THIS TABLE , WE PROVIDE THE % REDUCTION IN COST AS WELL AS ACCURACY WITH DIFFERENT DISTORTION LEVELS \u03c3 ON CALTECH -256 DATASET.Model/Distortion \u03c3 = 0.0 \u03c3 = 0.5 \u03c3 = 1 \u03c3 = 1.5 \u03c3 = 2 \u03c3 = 3Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc Cost Acc CostFinal layer 78.5 100 75.2 100 71.6 100 69.8 100 67.8 100 64.1 100Random exit -4.1 -33.5% -3.4 -20.1% -5.1 -39.7% -7.2 -41.3% -6.2 -37.8% -9.5 -43.9%AdaEE -3.3 -45.8% -4.2 -47.1% -4.6 -47.4% -5.8 -49.7% -5.7 -53.0% -5.2 -50.2%Early-Exit -5.3 -39.2% -9.1 -38.5% -9.9 -38.5% -10.5 -38.8% -10.1 -38.4% -10.8 -37.8%I-SplitEE -2.0 -66.3% -2.1 -65.9% -3.9 -66.7% -5.0 -67.4% -4.8 -66.4% -4.7 -65.7%A. Baselines1) Final-layer: We form this as our main baseline as itis similar to the MobileNet\u2019s inference. However, added exitsmight marginally deteriorate the performance.2) Random exit: We randomly choose a splitting layer andthen exploit that layer for the complete dataset. We choosethe random splitting layer for 10 times and then average theresults provided in table I.3) AdaEE: fixes the splitting layer and then adaptivelychooses the threshold as given in the paper [7]. There isan option to offload but the splitting layer is fixed. All thehyperparameters were kept the same as in the paper.4) Early-Exit: is similar to the classic early exiting setupwhere all the samples are inferred at the edge device and basedon the confidence values being above a given threshold. Thesample passes through the backbone until it obtains sufficientconfidence.B. Impact of change in distortionTo gain a deeper understanding of the influence of im-age distortion, we conducted an analysis of the confi-dence values associated with the final layer of our model.Pristine= 0.0noise= 0.5noise= 1noise= 1.5noise= 2noise= 2.5noise= 3Distortion0.20.40.60.81.0ConfidenceFig. 4.

The visualrepresentation inthis figure servesas a compellingillustration of the significant impact that image distortionexerts on the model\u2019s confidence. There is a loss in confidenceas the distortion in images increases and might affect themodel if a fixed splitting layer is used. This observationcompels us to adaptively choose the splitting layer as witha change in the underlying distribution of the dataset thedistribution of confidence values also changes at differentexits including the final exit.TABLE IISIMILAR RESULTS AS IN TABLE I FOR CIFAR -10.

Analysis over different overheadsGiven that the offloading cost is a user-defined parameter,we conducted a comprehensive analysis by varying this costwithin the set of values {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} in figure 2.This exploration focused on examining the behaviour of bothaccuracy and cost under different offloading cost scenarios.As the offloading cost increases, it is unsurprising that theoverall cost also rises. Notably, this increase in the offloadingcost does not result in a significant impact on accuracy. Thisobservation suggests the robustness of I-SplitEE to variationsin offloading cost, ensuring that accuracy remains relativelystable. However, we observe that the choice of the optimalsplitting layer adjusts with shifts in the offloading cost. Whenthe offloading cost is elevated, I-SplitEE opts for a deepersplitting layer, aligning with expectations, as the computa-tional cost becomes relatively smaller compared to the offload-ing cost. Consequently, the algorithm\u2019s design prompts thesample to be locally inferred on the edge device. Remarkably,this decision does not compromise the accuracy of the model,due to offloading of samples with low confidence on the edgedevice. As a result, every prediction maintains a high level ofconfidence, resulting in only a marginal reduction in accuracy.Moreover, our analysis reveals that even from a cost per-spective, our model outperforms the early-exit baseline. Thisfinding strengthens the claims regarding the efficacy of I-SplitEE and its ability to strike a compelling balance betweenaccuracy and cost.VI. R ESULTSIn Table I, II, we present the significant outcomes of I-SplitEE, providing insights into accuracy and cost metricsfor images exhibiting varying levels of distortion. Notably,our proposed method, I-SplitEE, demonstrates its remark-able performance by yielding the smallest performance drop(\u2264 5%) and the most substantial cost reduction ( > 65%) incomparison to the final exit. The cost values in the table are--- Page 6 ---computed as the cumulative sum of both computational andoffloading costs over the entire dataset. It is worth notingthat both the \u201dFinal Layer\u201d and \u201dEarly Exit\u201d baselines entailexecuting all computations on the mobile device, resulting ina significant computational cost that impacts the efficiency ofthe edge device. The accuracy loss observed in the \u201dEarlyExit\u201d scenario primarily stems from misclassifications madeby intermediate classifiers, which are subsequently rectifiedin the deeper layers. On the other hand, both \u201dRandom Exit\u201dand \u201dAdaEE\u201d provide an option to offload, but they havefixed splitting layers, preventing dynamic adaptation of thesplitting point. \u201dAdaEE,\u201d however, possesses the advantageof adjusting thresholds based on contextual information.Comparing our method with other baselines, I-SplitEEshowcases a remarkable reduction in cost by efficiently opti-mizing resource utilization on both edge and cloud platforms.The distinct advantage of I-SplitEE lies in its adaptive nature,enabling it to select the optimal splitting layer based on pastsamples. It accounts for a minimal reduction in accuracydue to offloading to the cloud. Overall, I-SplitEE effectivelyoptimizes resource utilization across both mobile devices andcloud infrastructure by balancing the computational as wellas communication costs.VII. C ONCLUSIONWe address the problem of executing the DNNs on edgedevices by considering the resources available on the edge.We propose a method that combines early exits and splitcomputing to reduce the computational cost of inference onedge devices as well as communication costs to the cloud.The developed algorithm I-SplitEE splits the DNN based onthe resources available where the initial part of the DNN isdeployed on the edge device with an exit attached at thelast layer on the edge device. If the sample gains sufficientconfidence on the edge device, it is inferred locally, else itis offloaded to the cloud for inference on the final layer ofDNN. I-SplitEE adapts to changes in the distribution of thetest data when it data arrives in an online and unsupervised.Notably, I-SplitEE has a minimal drop in accuracy even whencost changes making it more robust to different user-specificdevices.Our work could be extended by simultaneously adaptingto the optimal threshold as well as the splitting layer. Also,our method finds the optimal splitting layer based on all thesamples, however, the splitting layer could be learned basedon the difficulty level of the individual samples.REFERENCES[1] K.

However, direct training of deep spiking\nneural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained\nartificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the\nneurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more\nefficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for\nthat purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many\nspikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the\naccuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,\nand the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for\nclassifying an image.

At\npresent, spiking neural networks (SNN) have developed rapidly in HSI\nclassification tasks due to their low energy consumption and event driven\ncharacteristics. However, it usually requires a longer time step to achieve\noptimal accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper builds a\nspiking neural network (SNN-SWMR) based on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\nneuron model for HSI classification tasks. The network uses the spiking width\nmixed residual (SWMR) module as the basic unit to perform feature extraction\noperations. The spiking width mixed residual module is composed of spiking\nmixed convolution (SMC), which can effectively extract spatial-spectral\nfeatures. Secondly, this paper designs a simple and efficient arcsine\napproximate derivative (AAD), which solves the non-differentiable problem of\nspike firing by fitting the Dirac function. Through AAD, we can directly train\nsupervised spike neural networks. Finally, this paper conducts comparative\nexperiments with multiple advanced HSI classification algorithms based on\nspiking neural networks on six public hyperspectral data sets. Experimental\nresults show that the AAD function has strong robustness and a good fitting\neffect. Meanwhile, compared with other algorithms, SNN-SWMR requires a time\nstep reduction of about 84%, training time, and testing time reduction of about\n63% and 70% at the same accuracy. This study solves the key problem of SNN\nbased HSI classification algorithms, which has important practical significance\nfor promoting the practical application of HSI classification algorithms in\nedge devices such as spaceborne and airborne devices.\nPublication Date: 2024-09-18\narXiv paper ID: 2409.11619v1\n\nTitle: A Deep Unsupervised Feature Learning Spiking Neural Network with Binarized Classification Layers for EMNIST Classification using SpykeFlow\nSummary: End user AI is trained on large server farms with data collected from the\nusers.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be\nthe third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these\nlatency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal\ncommunication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,\nhowever, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a\nmethod for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge\ndetection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge\ndetection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D\nstatic images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y\nsignals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling\napproach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough\ndetail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding\nmechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)\nare then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains.

However, direct training of deep spiking neural net-works is di\ufb03cult, and previous methods for converting trained arti\ufb01cial neural net-works to spiking neurons were ine\ufb03cient because the neurons had to emit too manyspikes. We show that a substantially more e\ufb03cient conversion arises when one op-timizes the spiking neuron model for that purpose, so that it not only matters forinformation transmission how many spikes a neuron emits, but also when it emitsthose spikes. This advances the accuracy that can be achieved for image classi\ufb01cationwith spiking neurons, and the resulting networks need on average just two spikes perneuron for classifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improveslatency and throughput of the resulting spiking networks.Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are currently explored as possible solution for a majorimpediment of more widespread uses of modern AI in edge devices: The energy consump-tion of the large state-of-the-art arti\ufb01cial neural networks (ANNs) that are produced bydeep learning.This holds in particular for the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are com-monly used for image classi\ufb01cation, but also other application domains. These ANNs haveto be large for achieving top performance, since they need to have a su\ufb03ciently largenumber of parameters in order to absorb enough information from the huge data setson which they have been trained, such as the 1.2 million images of the ImageNet2012dataset. Inference with standard hardware implementations of these large ANNs is inher-ently power-hungry [Garc\xb4 \u0131a-Mart\xb4 \u0131n et al., 2019].1arXiv:2002.00860v4  [cs.NE]  26 Jan 2021--- Page 2 ---Spiking neurons have been in the focus of the development of novel computing hardwarefor AI with a drastically reduced energy budget, partially because the giant SNN of thebrain \u2013consisting of about 100 billion neurons\u2013 consumes just 20W [Ling, 2001]. Spikingneurons output trains of stereotypical pulses that are called spikes. Hence their output isvery di\ufb00erent from the continuous numbers that an ANN neuron produces as output. Mostspiking neuron models that are considered for implementation in neuromorphic hardwareare inspired by simple models for spiking neurons in the brain. However, these simpleneuron models do not capture the capability of biological neurons to encode di\ufb00erentinputs by di\ufb00erent temporal spike patterns, not just by their \ufb01ring rate (see Fig. 1 for anexample).Figure 1: Encoding of di\ufb00erent input values (current steps of di\ufb00erent ampli-tudes) by temporal spike patterns in a biological neuron. Data taken from theAllen Cell Type Database1 (Layer 3 spiny neuron from the human middle temporal gyrus).While large ANNs, trained with ever more sophisticated deep learning algorithms ongiant data sets, approach \u2013and sometimes exceed\u2013 human performance in several categoriesof intelligence, the performance of the current generation of spike-based neuromorphichardware is lagging behind. There is some hope that this gap can be closed for the case ofrecurrent spiking neural networks, since those can be trained directly to achieve most ofthe performance of recurrent ANNs [Bellec et al., 2020].1 \xa9 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Cell Types Database. Available from:https://celltypes.brain-map.org/experiment/electrophysiology/5877702512--- Page 3 ---But the problem to produce SNNs that achieve similar performance as ANNs with fewspikes persists for feedforward networks. Feedforward CNNs that achieve really good im-age classi\ufb01cation accuracy tend to be very deep and very large, and training correspondingdeep and large feedforward SNNs has not been able to reach similar classi\ufb01cation accuracy.Problems with the timing of spikes and precision of \ufb01ring rates on higher levels of the re-sulting SNNs have been cited as possible reasons. One attractive alternative is to simplytake a well-performing trained CNN and convert it into an SNN \u2013using the same connec-tions and weights. The most common \u2013and so far best performing\u2014 conversion methodwas based on the idea of (\ufb01ring-) rate coding, where the analog output of an ANN unit isemulated by the \ufb01ring rate of a spiking neuron [Rueckauer et al., 2017]. This method hadproduced so far the best SNN results for image classi\ufb01cation. But the transmission of ananalog value through a \ufb01ring rate tends to require a fairly large number of spikes, whichreduces both latency and throughput of the network. Furthermore, the resulting SNNtends to produce so many spikes that its energy-advantage over non-spiking hardware getslost. Finally, a rate-based ANN-to-SNN conversion can not be applied to those ANNs thatcurrently achieve the highest accuracy on ImageNet, E\ufb03cientNets [Tan and Le, 2019], be-cause these employ an activation function that assumes both positive and negative values:the SiLU function [Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016].We introduce a new ANN-to-SNN conversion that we call FS-conversion because itrequires a spiking neuron to emit just a few spikes (FS = Few Spikes). This methodis completely di\ufb00erent from rate-based conversions, and exploits the option of temporalcoding with spike patterns, where the timing of a spike transmits extra information.Most previously proposed forms of temporal coding, see e.g. [Maass and Natschl\xa8 ager,1998], [Thorpe et al., 2001], [Rueckauer et al., 2017], [Kheradpisheh and Masquelier, 2020],have turned out to be di\ufb03cult to implement e\ufb03ciently in neuromorphic hardware becausethey require to transmit \ufb01ne time-di\ufb00erences between spikes to downstream neurons. Incontrast, an FS-conversion can be implemented with just log Ndi\ufb00erent values of spiketimes and at most log Nspikes for transmitting integers between 1 and N. Practically, therequired number of spikes can be made even lower because not all N values occur equallyoften. However FS-conversion requires a modi\ufb01ed spiking neuron model, the FS-neuron,which has an internal dynamic that is optimized for emulating particular types of ANNneurons with few spikes. We demonstrate the performance of SNNs that result from FS-conversion of CNNs, on two state-of-the-art datasets for image classi\ufb01cation: ImageNet2012and CIFAR10. This optimized spiking neuron model could serve as guidance for the nextgeneration of neuromorphic hardware.Emulating an ANN neuron by a spiking neuron withfew spikesThe FS-conversion from ANNs to SNNs requires a variation of the standard spiking neuronmodel, to which we refer as FS-neuron. The computation step of a generic arti\ufb01cial neuron3--- Page 4 ---in an ANN (see Fig. 2 a) is emulated by K time steps of an FS-neuron (Fig. 2 b). Itsinternal dynamics is de\ufb01ned by \ufb01xed parameters T(t),h(t),d(t) for t= 1,...,K . These areoptimized to emulate the activation function f(x) of the given ANN neuron by a weightedsum of spikes \u2211Kt=1 d(t)z(t), where z(t) denotes the spike train that this neuron produces.More precisely: z(t) = 1 if the neuron \ufb01res at step t, else z(t) = 0. To emit a spike attime t, a neuron\u2019s membrane potential v(t) has to surpass the current value T(t) of its\ufb01ring threshold. We assume that the membrane potential v(t) has no leak, but is reset tov(t) \u2212h(t) after a spike at time t. Expressed in formulas, the membrane potential v(t)starts with value v(1) = x where x is the gate input, and evolves during the K stepsaccording tov(t+ 1) = v(t) \u2212h(t)z(t). (1)The spike output z(t) of an FS-neuron for gate input x can be de\ufb01ned compactly byz(t) = \u0398(v(t) \u2212T(t)) = \u0398((x\u2212t\u22121\u2211j=1h(j)z(j))\u2212T(t)), t = 1,...,K, (2)where \u0398 denotes the Heaviside step function. The total output \u02c6f(x) of the FS-neuron fromthese K time steps, which is collected by the FS-neurons on the next layer, can be writtenas:\u02c6f(x) =K\u2211t=1d(t)z(t). (3)An illustration of the model can be found in Fig. 2b.Figure 2: Conversion of an ANN neuron into an FS-neuron.a) A generic ANN neuron with activation function f(x) that is to be emulated.b) An FS-neuron which emulates this ANN neuron in K time steps t= 1,...,K . Its outputspike train is denoted by z(t).4--- Page 5 ---For emulating the ReLU activation function one can choose the parameters of the FS-neuron so that they de\ufb01ne a coarse-to-\ufb01ne processing strategy for all input values x thatlie below some upper bound, as described in the Methods section. For emulating the SiLUfunction of E\ufb03cientNet one achieves a better FS-conversion if the parameters are chosenin such a way that they enable iterative \u2013and thereby more precise\u2013 processing for therange of inputs between \u22122 and 2 that occur most often as gate inputs x in E\ufb03cientNet.The resulting dynamics of FS-neurons is illustrated in Fig. 3 for the case of the SiLU andsigmoid activation functions.All FS-neurons that emulate ANN neurons with the same activation function can usethe same parameters T(t), h(t), d(t), while the factor w in the weights of their outputspikes is simply lifted from the corresponding synaptic connection in the trained ANN (seeFig. 2).5--- Page 6 ---Figure 3: Internal dynamics of Few-Spikes neurons.The \ufb01rst row depicts the response of the FS-neurons to a low input value ( x= \u22120.5) andthe second row displays the response to a high input ( x = 0.5). The \ufb01rst column showsresponses of an SiLU FS-neuron, while the second column a sigmoid FS-neuron. Therelevant values of T(t) and v(t) for discrete time steps t (see Fig. 4b and d) are smoothlyinterpolated for illustration.Note that the number of neurons and connections in the network is not increasedthrough the FS-conversion. However the number of computation steps L of a feedforwardANN with Llayers is increased by the factor K. But the computations of the ANN can beemulated in a pipelined manner, where a new network input (image) is processed every 2Ktime steps by the SNN. In this case the parameters of the FS-neurons change periodically6--- Page 7 ---with a period of length K while the FS-neurons compute. These K steps are followed byK time steps during which the FS-neurons are inactive, while the FS-neurons on the nextlayer collect their spike inputs for emulating the next computation step or layer of theANN. Note that since all FS-neurons that emulate ANN neurons with the same activationfunction can use the same parameters T(t), h(t), d(t), they require only little extra memoryon a neuromorphic chip.Both the TensorFlow code and the chosen parameters of the FS-neurons are availableonline\u2217.Application to ImageNetThe ImageNet data set [Russakovsky et al., 2015] has become the most popular bench-mark for state-of-the-art image classi\ufb01cation in machine learning (we are using here theImageNet2012 version). This data set consists of 1 .281.167 training images and 50.000 testimages (both RGB images of di\ufb00erent sizes), that are labeled by 1000 di\ufb00erent categories.Classifying images from ImageNet is a nontrivial task even for a human, since this dataset contains for example 59 categories for birds of di\ufb00erent species and gender [Van Hornet al., 2015]. This may explain why a relaxed performance measurement, where one recordswhether the target class is among the top 5 classi\ufb01cations that are proposed by the neuralnetwork (\u201dTop5\u201d), is typically much higher.The recently proposed E\ufb03cientNet [Tan and Le, 2019] promises to become a new stan-dard CNN architecture due to its very high accuracy while utilizing a smaller number ofparameters than other CNN architectures. E\ufb03cientNet uses as activation function f(x)besides the SiLU function (Fig. 4) also the familiar sigmoid function, shown as the redcurve in Fig. 4 c. Note that 99 .97% of its activation functions are SiLU functions, makingthe appearance of the sigmoid function comparatively rare. The SiLU function emergedfrom preceding work on optimizing activation functions in ANNs [Zoph and Le, 2018].Another characteristic of the E\ufb03cientNet architecture is the extensive usage of depth-wiseseparated convolution layers. In between them, linear activation functions are used. Al-though it would certainly be possible to approximate linear functions using FS-coding, wesimply collapsed linear layers into the generation of the weighted sums that form the inputsto the next layers.Since the SiLU function assumes also negative values, it appears to be di\ufb03cult to convertan ANN with this activation function via rate-coding to a spiking neuron. But it is fairlyeasy to convert it to an FS-neuron. The values of the parameters T(t),h(t) and d(t) fort= 1,...,K of the FS-neuron can be obtained by training the FS-neuron model to \ufb01t theSiLU function, see Fig. 4 a and b. We used for that backpropagation through time, witha triangle-shaped pseudo derivative for the non-existing derivative of the Heaviside stepfunction.In most cases, the possible inputs to an activation function are not uniformly dis-tributed, but there exists a certain region in which most inputs lie with high probability.\u2217https://github.com/christophstoeckl/FS-neurons7--- Page 8 ---For example, most of the inputs to the SiLU functions in the E\ufb03cientNet are in the in-terval from \u22122 to 2 and therefore, achieving a high approximation accuracy in this regionis especially desirable, (see Fig. 5 a). It is possible to encourage the FS-neuron to putmore emphasis on a certain region, by assigning a high weight in the loss function to thisregion. More details about the training procedure of the FS-parameters can be found inthe Methods section.The e\ufb00ective activation function of the resulting FS-neuron is shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4c shows the corresponding result for the FS-conversion of an ANN neuron with the sigmoidactivation function.Figure 4: Approximations \u02c6f(x) of di\ufb00erent activation functions by FS-neuronsa) Approximation of the SiLU function with a single FS-neuron.(red: SiLU function, blue: FS-approximation with K = 16)b) Optimized internal parameters of the SiLU FS-neuron.c) Approximation of the sigmoid function with a single FS-neuron.d) Optimized internal parameters of the sigmoid FS-neuron.e) Approximation of the ReLU function with K = 10 and \u03b1= 25.8--- Page 9 ---Model ANNaccuracyaccuracy of theSNN producedby FS-conversion# params # layers # neurons # spikesImageNet2012E\ufb03cientNet-B7 85%(97.2 %)83.57%(96.7%) 66M 218 259M 554.9MResNet50 75.22%(92.4%)75.10%(92.36%) 26M 50 9.6M 14.045MCIFAR10ResNet8 87.22% 87.05% 78k 8 73k 103kResNet14 90.49% 90.39% 174k 14 131k 190kResNet20 91.58% 91.45% 271k 20 188k 261kResNet50 92.99% 92.42% 755k 50 475k 647kTable 1: Accuracy and spike numbers for classifying images from ImageNetwith FS-conversions of two state-of-the-art CNNs. The SNNs produced by FS-conversion of the ANNs achieved almost the same accuracy, and usually used at most 2spikes per neuron. Top5 accuracy is reported in parentheses. The number of spikes neededfor inference was obtained by averaging over the 1000 test images.Using these FS-neurons it is possible to emulate the E\ufb03cientNet-B7 model with spikingneurons. The accuracy of the resulting spiking CNN, using the publicly available weightsw of the trained E\ufb03cientNet, can be found in Table 1, together with the total number ofspikes that it uses for sample inferences.The FS-conversion of E\ufb03cientNet-B7 achieved an accuracy of 83 .57%. The best ac-curacy for ImageNet that had previously been reported for SNNs was 74 .6% [Rueckaueret al., 2017]. It was achieved by a rate-based conversion, which required a substantialnumber of spikes per neuron and about 550 time steps for each image classi\ufb01cation. TheSNN resulting from FS-conversion of E\ufb03cientNet-B7 used about 2 spikes per neuron forclassifying an image. The FS-neurons approximating the SiLU function used K = 16 andthe FS-neurons approximating the sigmoid function used K = 12.The layers of the CNN that use the SiLU function as activation function can be simu-lated in a pipelined manner by the SNN, processing a new image every 2 K time steps: Its\ufb01rst K time steps are spent collecting the outputs from the preceding layer of FS-neuronsduring their K time steps of activity. It then processes these collected inputs xduring thesubsequent K time steps.Hence the SNN that results from FS-conversion of E\ufb03cientNet can classify a new imageevery 2K = 32 time steps. Further implementation details can be found in the Methodssection.9--- Page 10 ---Approximating the ReLU activation functionThe ReLU activation function, see Fig. 4 d, is among the most frequently used activationfunctions, and also quite good accuracies have been achieved with it for ImageNet. Itrepresents a special case for FS-conversion, as it is possible to \ufb01nd the ideal values forh(t),T(t) and d(t) analytically, bases on the idea of computation with binary numbers.By setting the parameters of the FS-neuron to T(t) = h(t) = d(t) = 2 K\u2212t, the FS-neuron approximates the ReLU activation function f(x) with a coarse-to-\ufb01re-processingstrategy. Let us assume for simplicity that an FS-neuron receives inputs xfrom (\u2212\u221e,0] \u222a{1,2,..., 2K \u22121}. Then it reproduces with the speci\ufb01ed parameters the output ReLU( x)of the ReLU gate for any x from (\u2212\u221e,0] \u222a{1,2,..., 2K \u22121}without error. In order to beable to transmit also non-integer values xbetween 0 and some arbitrary positive constant\u03b1, one simply multiplies the given values for T(t),h(t) and d(t) with \u03b12\u2212K. Then the FS-neuron reproduces ReLU(x) for any non-negative xless than \u03b1that are multiples of \u03b12\u2212Kwithout error, and ReLU( x) is rounded down for values x in between to the next largermultiple of \u03b12\u2212K. Thus the output of the FS-neuron deviates for xin the range from \u2212\u221eto \u03b1 by at most \u03b12\u2212K from the output of the ReLU gate. The resulting approximation isplotted for \u03b1= 10 in Fig. 4 d. Several advantages arising from the simple structure of theparameters have been laid out in the Methods section.The accuracy of 75.22% for the ANN version of ResNet50 in Table 1 resulted from train-ing a variant of ResNet50 where max-pooling was replaced by average pooling, using thehyperparameters given in the TensorFlow repository\u2020. The resulting accuracy in ImageNetis close to the best published performance of 76% for ResNet50 ANNs [Tan and Le, 2019,Table 2]. The application of the FS-conversion to this variant of ResNet50 (with K = 10and \u03b1= 25) yields an SNN whose Top1 and Top5 performance is almost indistinguishablefrom that of the ANN version.Application to CIFAR10CIFAR10 [Krizhevsky et al., 2009] is a smaller and more frequently used dataset for imageclassi\ufb01cation. It consists of 60.000 colored images, each having a resolution of just 32 by32 pixels, and just 10 image classes. The results for ANN versions of ResNet that are givenin Table 1 for CIFAR10 arise from training them with the hyperparameters given in theTensorFlow models repository. They use the ReLU function as the only nonlinearity, sincewe have replaced there max-pooling by average pooling. Nevertheless, they achieve anaccuracy for CIFAR10 which is very close to the best results reported for CIFAR10 in theliterature. The best performing reported ResNet on CIFAR10 is ResNet110, where a testaccuracy of 93.57% had been achieved [He et al., 2016]. Our ResNet50 achieves 92.99%,which is similar to their accuracy of 93.03% for ResNet56.\u2020https://github.com/tensor\ufb02ow/tpu/tree/master/models/o\ufb03cial/e\ufb03cientnet10--- Page 11 ---Analysis of FS-codingOn digital neuromorphic hardware the energy consumption is proportional to the numberof spikes which are needed for a computation. The number of spikes needed for an FS-neuron to perform the approximation of the target function is depicted in Fig. 5 a and bas function of the gate input x. If one compares these numbers with the distribution ofinput values x (red curves) that typically occur during image classi\ufb01cation, one sees whyon average less than 2 spikes are used by FS-neurons for these applications.11--- Page 12 ---Figure 5: Number of spikes needed by FS-neurons for image classi\ufb01cation andin\ufb02uence of K and bit precision Q on performancea) The number of spikes used by an a FS-neuron with K = 16 to approximate the SiLU function, asfunction of its input value x.

Fig. 5c, d provide insight into the nature of the trade-o\ufb00 between the size of Kand the approximation quality of the FS-neuron.Furthermore, it is of interest to consider scenarios where only a certain number of bitsare available for the FS-neuron parameters. To analyze the impact of that we considera setting where the parameters of the FS-neurons can only take on discrete values in therange from [\u22128,8]. The possible values are equally spaced and the number of values can bewritten as 2Q, where Qrefers to the number of bits which are available for each parameterT(t), h(t), d(t) of the FS-neuron. Fig. 5e, f depict the impact of such quantization on themean squared error of the approximation of the activation function.Expected implementation cost on neuromorphic hardwareWe distinguish three types of neuromorphic hardware\u2022 Digital, but hardware not constrained to a particular neuron model (example: SpiN-Naker)\u2022 Digital, but hardware is constrained to a particular neuron model (example: Loihi)\u2022 Mixed digital analog (examples: IBM research chip with memristors and BrainScaleS-2)SpiNNakerThe SpiNNaker platform [Furber et al., 2014] provides a \ufb02exible environment which is notconstrained to a speci\ufb01c neuron model. SpiNNaker allows to compute all products d(t)won the chip, which reduces the additional memory consumption to to a small constantvalue. All parameters T(t), h(t) and d(t) only need to be stored in memory once, as theycan be shared across all neurons which approximate the same activation function. Theadditional computational complexity of the FS-neuron model also has a very small impact,as computing the updated weight d(t)w can be done with a single instruction cycle.LoihiLoihi [Davies et al., 2018] also promises to be an interesting target platform for FS-neurons.Especially FS-neurons approximating the ReLU activation function could be ported verye\ufb03ciently to this hardware platform. As the chip is based on \ufb01xed-point arithmetic, onecan implement T(t), h(t) and d(t) for ReLu using a single parameter, namely the sharedweight exponent. This is be possible due to the fact that at every time step t all FS-parameters have the same value, which is always a power of 2. Therefore, the additionalmemory consumption does not grow with K. It is also possible to use other activationfunctions besides ReLU on Loihi, however, in this case it would be necessary to store allproducts d(t)w on the chip, as computing the updated weight in an online fashion is notpossible. In this case, an increase in memory consumption of O(K) is expected.13--- Page 14 ---IBM research chip with memristorsIBM has presented an in-memory chip architecture supporting both ANNs and SNNs in theSupplementary Material S3 of the article [Wo\xb4 zniak et al., 2020]. This architecture employsa memristor crossbar array for fast (time complexity O(1)) and energy-e\ufb03cient multipli-cation of the outputs of one layer l of neurons with the weights of synaptic connectionsto neurons on the next layer l+ 1. One can replace all spikes (i.e., values 1) that emergefrom layer l at time t of the K-step cycle in the emulation of the neurons on layer l by acommon value value d(t) that is centrally stored. Since the values d(t) and 0 can be useddirectly as inputs to the memristor array, no signi\ufb01cant extra cost is expected. The neuronmodels are implemented in the digital part of this neuromorphic chip architecture of IBM,using very fast digital logic and SRAM for storing parameters. Since all neurons on a layerl of our FS networks use the same parameters T(t) and h(t), they can be stored in a localSRAM for all neurons on layer l, in a similar fashion as on SpiNNaker. A neuron modelthat goes already one step in the direction from LIF to FS-neurons has actually alreadybeen implemented on this architecture: The soft spiking neural unit (sSNU), that emitsanalog instead of binary values and subtracts a corresponding value from the membranepotential [Wo\xb4 zniak et al., 2020].BrainScaleS-2This neuromorphic chip [Billaudelle et al., 2020] is also a mixed analog digital architecturewhere a digital plasticity processor allows fast changes of synaptic weights, but also centralmemory storage and application of the time-varying parameters T(t), h(t) and d(t) ofthe neuron dynamics. Like on SpiNNaker, the parameters only have to be stored once inmemory and can be shared across many neurons. The leak term of the membrane voltageof the analog neuron models can be switched o\ufb00, so that the analog part can be used fore\ufb03cient matrix multiplication in a similar manner as on the IBM chip.MethodsIn this section various details necessary to reproduce our results have been listed. Ad-ditionally, to aid the interpretation of the results, a comparison to previous conversionapproaches has been added.When training the parameters of the FS-neurons it is important to specify an intervalin which the approximation should be very good. Ideally, most of the inputs to the ANNneuron should fall into this interval to guarantee a good performance. In our experiments,the FS-neurons have been trained to approximate the interval from [ \u22128,12] for the SiLUfunction and [ \u221210,10] for the sigmoid function. The resulting FS-neuron approximatesthe SiLU function with a mean squared error of 0 .0023 inside the main region [ \u22122,2] and0.0064 in the region outside, which can be written as [ \u22128,\u22122] \u222a[2,12]. As a result of our14--- Page 15 ---\ufb01ne-tuning the values for T(t), d(t) and h(t) stay for most time steps t within the mainregion [\u22122,2] as can be seen in Fig. 4b.To reduce the complexity of the converted CNN, we decided not to emulate the mul-tiplication operation by FS-neurons, which occurs in the CNN if the squeeze and excita-tion optimization [Hu et al., 2018] is being used. In many neuromorphic chips, such asSpiNNaker and Loihi, the on-chip digital processor could carry out these multiplications.Otherwise one can approximate multiplication in a similar manner as the SiLU functionwith a suitably optimized FS-neuron, see [St\xa8 ockl and Maass, 2019]. Alternatively one cancompute multiplication with a small circuit of threshold gates, i.e., very simple types ofspiking neurons, of depth 2 or 3. A recent summary of such results is provided in section3 of [Parekh et al., 2018].Due to the simple structure of the parameters of the ReLU FS-neurons several advan-tages arise. In particular when approximating the ReLU function with an FS-neuron it ispossible to calculate the changes of parameters for t= 1,...,K by simply using a bit shiftoperation, possibly providing a very e\ufb03cient implementation on neuromorphic hardware.The resulting SNN can be used in a pipelined manner, processing a new network inputevery 2K = 20 time steps, analogously as for the SiLU function.Further properties of FS-coding that are relevant for neuromor-phic hardwareOne of the major advantages of using FS-neurons in neuromorphic hardware is the smalleramount of time steps and spikes required to approximate arti\ufb01cial neurons. For the case ofthe ReLU activation function, a rate coded spiking neuron requires N time steps to encodeN di\ufb00erent values. FS-neurons improve upon this unary coding scheme by utilizing thetime dimension to implement a binary coding scheme. Therefore, the number of time stepsrequired to encode N di\ufb00erent values can be reduced to just log2(N).To underline the binary coding nature of FS-neurons, in the case of the ReLU activationfunction, the corresponding FS-neurons will show a spiking pattern equivalent to of theoutput of the ReLU function, written as a binary number. The same logarithmic relationholds not only for the number of time steps required but also for the number of spikes neededto transmit a value. More sophisticated codes could be used to make the computationrobust to noise in spike transmission.Note, that most of the inputs to the FS-neurons have a value close to 0, as shown inFig. 5 a and b. Consequently, the FS-neurons usually require only a few spikes to transmitthe output values, making the the coding scheme even more sparse in practice.Comparison with previous methodsThe idea of converting a pre-trained ANN to a SNN has received a fair amount of attentionin the recent years. The most popular conversion approaches are rate-based, meaning they15--- Page 16 ---translate the continuous output of an arti\ufb01cial ReLU neuron into a \ufb01ring rate of a spikingneuron. Unfortunately there are some drawbacks associated with rate-coding. Due to itsunary coding nature, rate-codes are sub-optimal in the sense that they do not make gooduse of the time dimension. Usually a large amount of time steps is required to achieve asu\ufb03ciently accurate approximation. Furthermore, rate-based conversions are only capableof converting simple activation functions like ReLU, but fail to convert more sophisticatedfunctions like SiLU.Another popular conversion approach uses time to \ufb01rst spike (TTFS) coding [Rueckauerand Liu, 2018]. This approach encodes the continuous outputs of the corresponding ReLUANN neurons in the length of the time interval until the \ufb01rst spike, resulting in a verysparse spiking activity. However, this method seems to not scale easily to large modelsand has, to the best of our knowledge, not been tested on large data sets like ImageNet.The idea of using single spike temporal coding has \ufb01rst been explored in [Maass, 1997] andit has been shown to have a variety of applications, like implementing an e\ufb03cient k-NNalgorithm on neuromorphic hardware [Frady et al., 2020].Furthermore, a new conversion method has been proposed, in which the spiking neuronscan approximate the ReLU function using a hysteresis quantization method [Yousefzadehet al., 2019]. This approach waits to be tested on larger networks and datasets.One property that all previously mentioned conversion methods have in common is thatthey only consider transforming arti\ufb01cial ReLU neurons to spiking neurons, and thereforecannot convert more sophisticated activation functions, which are used in network archi-tecture like the E\ufb03cientNets.A detailed summary comparing FS-coding to previous results can be found in theExtended Data Table 1.It is worth noting, that the throughput using FS-coding is substantially better thanthat of SNNs which result from rate-based ANN-to-SNN conversions of ANNs with theReLU function, as proposed for example in [Rueckauer et al., 2017, Sengupta et al., 2019].The Inception-v3 model in [Rueckauer et al., 2017] was reported to yield a SNN that needed550 time steps to classify an image. Under the assumption that rate-based models pro\ufb01tonly very little from pipelining, it is reasonable to estimate that the throughput of an SNNthat results from FS-conversion of ReLU gates with K = 10 is roughly 25 times higher.The SNN resulting from the rate-based conversion of the ResNet34 model discussedin [Sengupta et al., 2019] has been reported to use 2500 time steps for a classi\ufb01cation.Therefore we estimate that the throughput is increased here by a factor around 125 throughFS-conversion.Spiking versions of ResNet20 have already been previously explored [Sengupta et al.,2019]. Using a rate-based conversion scheme an accuracy of 87.46% was reported.FS-conversion of ResNet20 yields a substantially higher accuracy of 91.45%, using just80 to 500 time steps for each image -depending on the model depth- instead of 2000,thereby signi\ufb01cantly reducing latency. In addition, the throughput is drastically improved.Also the number of spikes that the SNN uses for classifying an image from CIFAR10is signi\ufb01cantly reduced when one moves from a rate-based conversion to an FS conversion.A converted ResNet11 has been reported to use more than 8 million spikes to classify16--- Page 17 ---a single test example [Lee et al., 2020]. Comparing this to an FS-converted ResNet14we \ufb01nd that the latter uses 40 times fewer spikes despite being a slightly larger model.Using direct training of SNNs instead of a conversion scheme has been reported to resultin a lower amount of spikes needed to perform a single classi\ufb01cation. However, even adirectly trained SNN version of ResNet11 uses 7 times more spikes than an FS-conversionof ResNet14 [Lee et al., 2020, Table 8].In [Rathi et al., 2020] the authors present a novel approach for obtaining high perfor-mance SNNs by combining a rate-based conversion scheme with a subsequent gradient-based \ufb01ne-tuning procedure. They report the highest accuracy for an SNN on CIFAR10,which was achieved by converting a very performant ANN. They also show results forImageNet, where they achieve an accuracy of 65 .1% on their ResNet-34. Deeper models,like the ResNet-50, were not considered in this work. On ImageNet FS-conversion of theResNet-50 model improves their accuracy by 10% and FS-conversion of the E\ufb03cientNet-B7surpasses their performance by 18.47%.DiscussionWe have presented a new approach for generating SNNs that are very close to ANNs interms of classi\ufb01cation accuracy for images, while working in the energetically most attrac-tive regime with very sparse \ufb01ring activity. Besides substantially improved classi\ufb01cationaccuracy, they exhibit drastically improved latency and throughput compared with rate-based ANN-to-SNN conversions. o\ufb00 the shelf. One can argue that this is exactly theway which evolution has chosen for the design of neurons in living organism. Not onlyneurons with particular information processing tasks in the smaller nervous systems ofinsects, but also neurons in the neocortex of mammals exhibit an astounding diversity ofgenetically encoded response properties [ [Sterling and Laughlin, 2015], [Gouwens et al.,2019], [Bakken et al., 2020]]. In particular, the probability of producing a spike dependsin diverse ways on the recent stimulation history of the neuron, see [Gerstner et al., 2014]for some standard models. In other words, the excitability of di\ufb00erent types of biologicalneurons increases or decreases in complex ways in response to their previous \ufb01ring. As aresult, the temporal structure of a train of spikes that is produced by a biological neuroncontains additional information about the neuron input that can not be captured by its\ufb01ring rate. Similary, FS-neurons that are optimized for high accuracy image classi\ufb01cationwith few spikes exhibit history-dependent changes -encoded through their functions T(t)and h(t) according to equ. (2)- in their propensity to \ufb01re, see Fig. 4b and 4e. Furthermorethe function d(t) enables subsequent neurons to decode their spikes in a timing-sensitivemanner. In these regards an FS-conversion from ANNs to SNNs captures more of the func-tional capabilities of spiking neurons than previously considered rate-based conversions toan o\ufb00-the-shelf spiking neuron model.It is well known that spikes from the same neurons in the brain can transmit di\ufb00erentinformation to downstream neurons depending on the timing of the spike, see e.g. phaseprecession in the hipppocampus [Harris et al., 2002]. Hence is is conceivable that down-17--- Page 18 ---stream neurons give di\ufb00erent weights to these spikes, in dependence of the \ufb01ring time ofthe presynaptic neuron. In fact, it is well known that the large repertoire of pre- andpostsynaptic synaptic dynamics found in di\ufb00erent synapses of the brain [Markram et al.,2004, Kopanitsa et al., 2018] enables postsynaptic neurons to modulate the amplitude ofpostsynaptic responses in dependence of the timing of presynaptic spikes relative to an un-derlying rhythm. This can be viewed as a biological counterpart of the timing-dependentweights d(t) in our model. Altogether we believe that FS-neurons provide a \ufb01rst step inexploring new uses of SNNs where information is not encoded by the timing of single spikesor \ufb01ring rates, but by temporal spike patterns.Important for applications of FS-coding in neuromorphic hardware is that it is ap-plicable to virtually any activation function, in particular to that activation function forANN neurons that currently provides the highest accuracy on ImageNet, the SiLU func-tion. Rate-based conversion can not be readily applied to the SiLU function because itassumes both positive and negative output values. When approximating the more com-monly used ReLU function, FS-neurons approach the information theoretic minimum ofspikes for spike-based communication.In fact, FS-neurons that emulate ANN gates with the ReLU activation function produce1.5 spikes on average for classifying an image, while those for the Switch activation functionproduce 2 spikes on average. As the number of spikes required for inference by an SNNis directly related to its energy consumption in spike-based neuromorphic hardware, theenergy consumption of FS-converted SNNs appears to be close to the theoretical optimumfor SNNs. Since FS-conversion provides a tight bound on the number K of time stepsduring which a spiking neuron is occupied, it can also be used for converting recurrentlyconnected ANNs to SNNs.The proposed method for generating highly performant SNNs for image classi\ufb01cationthrough FS-conversion of trained CNNs o\ufb00ers an opportunity to combine the computa-tionally more e\ufb03cient and functionally more powerful training of ANNs with the superiorenergy-e\ufb03ciency of SNNs for inference. Note that one can also use the resulting SNN asinitialization for further training of the SNN, e.g., for a more speci\ufb01c task.Altogether our results suggest that spike-based hardware may gain an edge in thecompetition for the development of drastically more energy-e\ufb03cient hardware for AI if onedoes not forgot to optimize the spiking neuron model in the hardware for its intendedrange of applications. In contrast to energy e\ufb03cient digital hardware that is optimizedfor speci\ufb01c ANN architectures and activation functions, see e.g. [Zhang et al., 2019] for areview, a spike-based neuromorphic chip that is able to emulate FS-neurons can carry outinference for all possible ANN architectures. It can also emulate ANNs with previouslynot considered activation functions, since a change of the activation function just requiresreprogramming of the digitally stored parameters of FS-neurons. Hence such spike-basedchip will be substantially more versatile than common digital hardware accelerators for AI.18--- Page 19 ---AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Franz Scherr for helpful discussions.

('', "Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet's effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity.

This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.

This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.

That's an interesting direction! Building on your suggestion, I propose we develop a "Spike-Guided Convex NAS" approach that combines three key innovations from the literature: 1) The convex optimization from 2410.06567v1, 2) NAS techniques from 2409.08943v1, and 3) spike-based efficiency from 2110.10217v1. The novel aspect would be using spike timing patterns from a lightweight SNN as an additional optimization signal during NAS to guide the convex-aware architecture search toward more energy-efficient designs. For the experiment, we could use CIFAR-10 on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) as our testbed, comparing against standard NAS and convex distillation baselines. We'd measure accuracy, latency, energy consumption (using a power monitor), and model size. The key innovation is using SNN spike patterns as a biologically-inspired efficiency heuristic during NAS - this hasn't been done before to my knowledge. What do you think about this hybrid neuromorphic-NAS approach?
