The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints.

The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks.

The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance.

The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%).

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet\\'s effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources, along with a single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-accuracy-complexity performance compared to existing methods, including traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression approaches. The system achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 0.93% better) while reducing encoding latency by 50% compared to baseline methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2401.10541v1, Summary: This paper introduces I-SplitEE, a novel approach combining split computing and early exits to optimize deep neural network inference on edge devices. The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%). The algorithm uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to adapt to changing data distributions in an online, unsupervised manner, making it particularly effective for real-world scenarios with varying image distortions. Experimental results on Caltech-256 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for converting trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) using optimized temporal coding with few spikes (FS-conversion). The key innovation is the FS-neuron model that encodes information in both spike timing and count, enabling high-accuracy image classification with an average of just 2 spikes per neuron. The method achieves 83.57% accuracy on ImageNet (comparable to the original ANN) while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The approach is particularly effective for edge devices, demonstrating improved latency and throughput through pipelined processing. The paper also shows successful application to various CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10), with detailed analysis of implementation costs on different neuromorphic hardware platforms.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Latency-Predictive Convex NAS" (LPC-NAS) - A novel hybrid approach combining:\\n1.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where the denoiser and classifier share an encoder, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to balance latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both tasks while meeting real-time constraints. The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance in human perception tasks like security surveillance and medical imaging.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, focusing on optimizing the rate-accuracy-complexity (RAC) trade-off. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled based on device computational constraints, along with a novel single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional image codecs and prior feature compression methods, achieving better classification accuracy at lower bit rates while maintaining computational efficiency. The system is particularly valuable for resource-constrained edge devices in applications like surveillance and IoT, where it enables effective collaboration between edge and cloud computing resources.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The approach incorporates hardware constraints like model size and FLOPs directly into the NAS optimization process through a differentiable formulation. Key innovations include weight sharing, channel bottleneck techniques, and derived cells to reduce search time. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS discovers models 10-15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The method demonstrates strong transferability across datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance-latency tradeoffs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.\\narXiv ID: 2210.06223v1, Summary: This paper introduces LASNet, a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network for efficient image classification on edge devices. The key innovation is a coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference approach guided by a novel latency prediction model that considers hardware properties, scheduling strategies, and algorithm design. LASNet achieves 36% and 46% latency reduction on Tesla V100 and Jetson TX2 GPUs respectively while maintaining accuracy, outperforming pixel-level dynamic networks. The method includes optimized operator fusion techniques and demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet classification as well as downstream tasks like object detection and instance segmentation. Experimental results show LASNet\\'s effectiveness in bridging the gap between theoretical FLOPs reduction and practical latency improvements for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an adaptive sampling and edge detection approach for encoding static images into spike trains for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method first performs Canny edge detection on images, then converts the edge maps into temporal signals which are adaptively sampled based on signal variation. The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST digits, showing 18x and 7x reduction in RMSE compared to conventional encoding methods while maintaining classification accuracy. Key innovations include the adaptive sampling mechanism that adjusts sampling rate based on signal dynamics and the edge-based signal conversion that reduces input dimensionality. Experimental results demonstrate the method\\'s effectiveness for low-power edge devices by significantly reducing spike counts while preserving signal fidelity.\\narXiv ID: 2410.06567v1, Summary: This paper introduces a novel convex optimization-based distillation technique for compressing deep neural networks for edge deployment. The key innovation is replacing non-convex activation functions with convex gating functions in the student model, enabling efficient compression without requiring labeled data or post-compression fine-tuning. Experiments on image classification tasks show the convex student models achieve comparable accuracy to non-convex counterparts while being more efficient to optimize. The method demonstrates particular advantages in low-sample regimes and high compression scenarios, making it promising for resource-constrained edge devices. The convex formulation also allows use of specialized convex solvers for faster convergence compared to traditional non-convex optimization approaches.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated architecture that shares an encoder between denoising and classification tasks, along with modifications to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize for target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Experimental results show the NAS-designed architectures outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving significant improvements in both denoising and classification while meeting strict latency constraints. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness in resource-constrained scenarios like medical imaging and surveillance systems, where both automated classification and human verification of noisy images are important.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression method for edge-cloud image classification systems, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity. The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks that can be scaled according to edge device computational resources, along with a single-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate superior rate-accuracy-complexity performance compared to existing methods, including traditional image codecs and state-of-the-art feature compression approaches. The system achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 0.93% better) while reducing encoding latency by 50% compared to baseline methods, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2401.10541v1, Summary: This paper introduces I-SplitEE, a novel approach combining split computing and early exits to optimize deep neural network inference on edge devices. The method dynamically selects the optimal splitting layer between edge and cloud based on prediction confidence, significantly reducing computational and communication costs (55% reduction) with minimal accuracy degradation (\u22645%). The algorithm uses a Multi-Armed Bandit framework to adapt to changing data distributions in an online, unsupervised manner, making it particularly effective for real-world scenarios with varying image distortions. Experimental results on Caltech-256 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in balancing accuracy and resource efficiency.\\narXiv ID: 2002.00860v4, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for converting trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) using optimized temporal coding with few spikes (FS-conversion). The key innovation is the FS-neuron model that encodes information in both spike timing and count, enabling high-accuracy image classification with an average of just 2 spikes per neuron. The method achieves 83.57% accuracy on ImageNet (comparable to the original ANN) while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to rate-based SNN conversions. The approach is particularly effective for edge devices, demonstrating improved latency and throughput through pipelined processing. The paper also shows successful application to various CNN architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10), with detailed analysis of implementation costs on different neuromorphic hardware platforms.\\nPlan: Research Idea: "Latency-Predictive Convex NAS" (LPC-NAS) - A novel hybrid approach combining:\\n1.
