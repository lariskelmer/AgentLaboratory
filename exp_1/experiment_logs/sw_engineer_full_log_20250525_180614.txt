('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel architecture that jointly combines image denoising and classification for edge devices. The authors propose an integrated model where a shared encoder is used for both tasks, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to meet target latency, classification accuracy, and denoising performance. Key experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed alternatives, achieving 76.4% classification accuracy and 25.2 PSNR on ImageNet100 with noise, while meeting real-time latency constraints (17.9ms on RTX 3090). The integrated approach demonstrates superior denoising quality compared to sequential models, particularly important for human verification in applications like medical imaging and surveillance.\\narXiv ID: 2211.09897v1, Summary: This paper presents an efficient feature compression system for edge-cloud image classification, addressing the three-way trade-off between bit rate, classification accuracy, and encoding complexity (RAC). The authors propose a flexible encoder architecture with residual blocks and 8\xd7 downsampling that can be scaled based on device capabilities. Key results show their method achieves 0.93% higher accuracy than prior work (Entropic Student) while reducing encoding latency by 51.4% (6.7ms vs 13.8ms on CPU). The system outperforms traditional image codecs (WebP, BPG) and learned compression methods across various bit rates, demonstrating effective optimization for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search method for optimizing deep learning models on edge devices. The key innovation is formulating NAS as a constrained optimization problem that incorporates hardware metrics like model size and FLOPs directly into the search objective. Experiments show DCA-NAS discovers models 15x smaller than manual architectures (e.g., 3.4M vs 5.8M parameters on CIFAR-10) with comparable accuracy, while reducing search time by 4-17x compared to prior hardware-aware NAS methods. The approach demonstrates strong transferability, with architectures searched on CIFAR-10 achieving competitive performance when evaluated on TinyImagenet and ImageNet-1k. The paper provides extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of techniques like weight sharing and channel bottlenecks for efficient search.\\narXiv ID: 2110.10217v1, Summary: This paper proposes an innovative approach for encoding static images into spike trains for spiking neural networks (SNNs) to address latency and power constraints in edge devices. The method combines Canny edge detection with adaptive temporal encoding, reducing signal length by 41.7% compared to raw images while maintaining classification-relevant features. Key innovations include: (1) an adaptive sampling algorithm that dynamically adjusts sampling rate based on signal variation, (2) optimized threshold selection using a novel fitness function combining SNR, RMSE and spike count metrics, and (3) demonstration of 18x and 7x RMSE reduction compared to conventional encoding methods. The approach shows particular promise for MNIST digit classification on neuromorphic hardware, achieving high reconstruction accuracy (SNR >100dB for Y signals) while significantly reducing computational requirements.\\narXiv ID: 2108.07879v1, Summary: This paper presents NeuRRAM, a groundbreaking resistive RAM (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM) chip that achieves unprecedented energy efficiency for edge AI applications. Key innovations include: (1) a transposable neurosynaptic array architecture enabling bidirectional dataflow for diverse AI workloads (CNNs, LSTMs, RBMs), (2) voltage-mode neuron circuits supporting 1-6 bit inputs and 1-8 bit outputs with 5-8\xd7 better energy-delay product than prior art, and (3) cross-layer co-optimization techniques that maintain software-comparable accuracy (99.0% MNIST, 85.7% CIFAR-10) despite analog hardware imperfections. The 48-core design demonstrates versatility across image classification, speech recognition, and image recovery tasks while consuming <250mW, making it particularly relevant for real-time edge image classification under strict power constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.02134v1, Summary: This paper comprehensively evaluates model compression techniques for ConvNeXt architectures on edge devices, focusing on structured/unstructured pruning and dynamic quantization. Key findings include: (1) OTOv3 structured pruning achieves 75% reduction in model size/parameters while increasing accuracy by 3.8% on fine-tuned ConvNeXt-Small; (2) Dynamic quantization provides 95% reduction in parameters/MACs with minimal accuracy drop (0.1%); (3) Combined OTOv3+quantization yields 89.7% size reduction and 95% MAC reduction while improving accuracy. The compressed model demonstrates practical viability with 92.5% accuracy and 20ms latency on edge hardware, making it highly relevant for real-time image classification under resource constraints.\\narXiv ID: 2409.08943v1, Summary: This paper presents a novel approach for joint image denoising and classification optimized for edge devices. The key innovation is a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that automatically designs efficient architectures combining both tasks while optimizing for target latency (7-18ms), classification accuracy, and denoising performance. The proposed "Integrated" architecture shares an encoder between denoising and classification branches, achieving superior results compared to sequential approaches. Experimental results show the NAS-designed models outperform manually designed baselines by significant margins (e.g., 25.6dB PSNR vs 25.0dB for denoising at 11.6ms latency). The work demonstrates practical viability for edge deployment in domains like medical imaging and surveillance systems through comprehensive latency-accuracy tradeoff analysis.\\narXiv ID: 2303.11319v1, Summary: This paper proposes EFOBDA, an error-feedback one-bit quantization scheme for federated edge learning that optimizes both communication efficiency and model accuracy. The key innovation is a novel power control policy that minimizes aggregation errors while maintaining low computational overhead. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show EFOBDA achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision methods (74.3% on CIFAR-10) while reducing communication costs through 1-bit quantization. The theoretical analysis demonstrates convergence guarantees under both AWGN and fading channels, with optimized power control reducing signal misalignment errors by up to 50%. The method enables efficient edge deployment with 10.3ms latency while maintaining high classification accuracy.\\narXiv ID: 2406.12079v1, Summary: This paper introduces Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP), a novel framework for joint channel, layer, and block pruning of deep neural networks under latency constraints. The key innovation is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation that simultaneously optimizes pruning decisions across all dimensions while accurately modeling latency impacts from both input and output channel variations. Experiments on ImageNet classification show MDP achieves 70.0% Top-1 accuracy at 5262 FPS (vs 68.6% at 4101 FPS for prior art HALP) when pruning ResNet-50 by 85%. For 3D object detection on NuScenes, MDP pruned models achieve higher mAP (0.451 vs 0.449) and FPS (37.3 vs 31.7) than the dense baseline. The method demonstrates particular effectiveness at high pruning ratios, with 18% speedup while maintaining accuracy.\\narXiv ID: 2307.04443v1, Summary: This paper presents DCA-NAS, a device constraints-aware neural architecture search framework that optimizes models for edge devices by incorporating memory and computational constraints directly into the search objective. The method uses weight sharing, channel bottlenecks, and derived cells to reduce search time while maintaining performance. Key innovations include a differentiable hardware-aware objective function with Lagrange multipliers and a lookup graph for constraint mapping. Experiments on CIFAR-10, TinyImagenet and ImageNet show DCA-NAS achieves 4x lower search time than prior NAS methods while discovering models 15x smaller than manual architectures with comparable accuracy (e.g., 97.2% on CIFAR-10 with 3.4M parameters).
