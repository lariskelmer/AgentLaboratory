('', "Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2011.14808v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper discusses deep learning optimization techniques for edge computing systems. It covers four main approaches: (1) hand-crafted lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, (2) model compression methods including pruning and quantization, (3) hardware-aware neural architecture search, and (4) adaptive deep learning models. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different techniques and their tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show these optimization methods can significantly reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy, making them suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches specialized for different image distortion types (blur and noise) to improve edge offloading efficiency. The key innovation is using a distortion classifier to select appropriate expert branches at each exit point, enabling more accurate early classification on edge devices. Experiments show the approach increases edge classification probability by 10-20% for distorted images while maintaining accuracy, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 30% compared to standard early-exit DNNs. The method is evaluated on Amazon EC2 instances across different geographic locations, demonstrating robustness under varying network conditions. The work provides important insights for optimizing real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices handling distorted inputs.\\narXiv ID: 2111.14243v1, Summary: EffCNet is an efficient version of CondenseNet designed for edge devices, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions and self-querying data augmentation to improve real-time inference performance. The paper demonstrates significant reductions in model size (from 16.7MB to 2.1MB for CIFAR-10), FLOPs (from 65.82M to 61.01M), and parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy (94.15% top-1 on CIFAR-10). The architecture was successfully deployed on NXP BlueBox 2.0, an edge platform for autonomous vehicles, showing practical applicability for resource-constrained environments.\\narXiv ID: 2502.10047v1, Summary: This paper presents Janus, a novel framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer (ViT) inference over dynamic networks. The key innovation is combining token pruning techniques with a fine-to-coarse model splitting policy to enable efficient ViT execution across edge and cloud resources. Janus dynamically selects optimal pruning levels and split points based on network conditions, achieving up to 5.15x throughput improvement and reducing latency violations by up to 98.7% compared to baselines while maintaining accuracy. The system includes a lightweight profiler for latency prediction and a dynamic scheduler for real-time configuration. Experimental results demonstrate Janus's effectiveness across image recognition and video classification tasks under various network conditions.\\narXiv ID: 2404.10407v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper evaluates four primary model compression techniques (quantization, low-rank approximation, knowledge distillation, and pruning) for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for edge deployment. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR datasets, the authors demonstrate that post-training quantization and knowledge distillation achieve the best trade-offs, reducing model size by 4x while maintaining accuracy. The paper also explores hybrid approaches, showing that combining quantization with knowledge distillation can double inference speed while reducing model size to 25% of original. Key findings include: 1) Dynamic quantization reduces ViT size to 84MB (from 327MB) with minimal accuracy drop (98.73% vs 98.94% on CIFAR-10), 2) DeiT tiny achieves 16.78 iterations/sec (vs 4.48 for vanilla ViT) with 95.43% accuracy, and 3) Hybrid approaches combining quantization and distillation achieve 2x speedup with manageable accuracy trade-offs.\\narXiv ID: 2303.08810v1, Summary: BiFormer introduces a novel bi-level routing attention (BRA) mechanism for vision transformers that enables dynamic, query-aware sparsity. BRA first filters irrelevant key-value pairs at a coarse region level (region-to-region routing) before applying fine-grained token-to-token attention in the remaining regions. This approach achieves O((HW)^(4/3)) complexity with proper region partitioning while maintaining global receptive fields. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification (83.8% top-1 accuracy for BiFormer-S), COCO object detection (47.1 mAP for BiFormer-B), and ADE20K semantic segmentation (49.9 mIoU for BiFormer-B). The method shows particular strength in preserving fine-grained details for small object detection, with BiFormer-S achieving 30.2 APs on COCO compared to 29.2 for WaveViT-S.\\narXiv ID: 2212.02687v3, Summary: This paper investigates dynamic inference techniques for vision transformers to enable efficient execution under varying resource constraints. Key findings include: (1) Convolutions dominate FLOPs in modern vision transformers (68-89%), not attention layers, due to integrated convolutions for accuracy/performance. (2) FLOP distribution poorly predicts GPU runtime due to optimized convolution execution. (3) Models show varying resilience to pruning - SegFormer achieves 28% energy savings with 1.4% accuracy drop without retraining, while ResNet-50 (via OFA) achieves 53% energy savings with 3.3% accuracy drop. The work provides insights for designing efficient vision transformers and dynamic execution strategies for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2405.00906v1, Summary: LOTUS introduces a novel method combining data lottery ticket selection and sparsity pruning to accelerate vision transformer training while maintaining accuracy. The approach identifies informative data subsets and eliminates redundant parameters through a three-phase process: (1) attention-map-based data lottery ticket identification, (2) Instant Sparse Soup Pruning (ISSP) for model compression, and (3) fine-tuning. Experiments show rapid convergence (reaching near-SOTA performance by 5 epochs) and maintain 79% accuracy at 30% sparsity on CIFAR-10, though ISSP showed accuracy drops due to aggressive pruning. The work demonstrates promising directions for efficient transformer training through combined data and model optimization.\\narXiv ID: 2111.15667v3, Summary: This paper introduces Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS), a parameter-free module for dynamically reducing the number of tokens in vision transformers based on input content. ATS uses attention weights to score token importance and performs inverse transform sampling to select significant tokens. Key results: 1) Reduces DeiT-S GFLOPs by 37% with only 0.1% accuracy drop on ImageNet; 2) Achieves 2x computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy on Kinetics-400/600; 3) Can be added to pre-trained models without fine-tuning. The method shows superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs compared to DynamicViT and EViT.\\narXiv ID: 2408.08437v1, Summary: This paper presents PQV-Mobile, a combined pruning and quantization toolkit for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for mobile/edge deployment. Key contributions: 1) Supports multiple structured pruning methods (magnitude, Taylor, Hessian importance) and quantization (FP32 to FP16/int8); 2) Achieves 7.18x latency reduction with only 2.24% accuracy drop on DeiT models; 3) Provides hardware-aware optimizations for various backends (x86, FBGEMM, QNNPACK).

Building on this, I propose a novel "Adaptive Token and Attention Routing" (ATAR) technique for Vision Transformers that combines three key innovations: (1) Input-difficulty classification to categorize images as simple/complex, (2) Dynamic token pruning based on both input difficulty and attention scores (using ATS-like approach), and (3) Attention head routing that selectively activates only relevant heads per input. For the experiment, we could use DeiT-Tiny as base model on Raspberry Pi 4 with CIFAR-100, comparing against standard DeiT and DynamicViT baselines. We'd measure accuracy, latency (using PyTorch profiler), and energy consumption (via power monitor). The key novelty is the joint optimization of token and head computation based on input characteristics - this hasn't been explored in literature yet.

('', 'Current Literature Review: Provided here is a literature review on this topic:\\narXiv ID: 2011.14808v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper discusses deep learning optimization techniques for edge computing systems. It covers four main approaches: (1) hand-crafted lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, (2) model compression methods including pruning and quantization, (3) hardware-aware neural architecture search, and (4) adaptive deep learning models. The paper provides detailed comparisons of different techniques and their tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show these optimization methods can significantly reduce model size and computational complexity while maintaining competitive accuracy, making them suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.\\narXiv ID: 2108.09343v2, Summary: This paper proposes an early-exit DNN architecture with expert branches specialized for different image distortion types (blur and noise) to improve edge offloading efficiency. The key innovation is using a distortion classifier to select appropriate expert branches at each exit point, enabling more accurate early classification on edge devices. Experiments show the approach increases edge classification probability by 10-20% for distorted images while maintaining accuracy, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 30% compared to standard early-exit DNNs. The method is evaluated on Amazon EC2 instances across different geographic locations, demonstrating robustness under varying network conditions. The work provides important insights for optimizing real-time image classification on resource-constrained edge devices handling distorted inputs.\\narXiv ID: 2111.14243v1, Summary: EffCNet is an efficient version of CondenseNet designed for edge devices, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions and self-querying data augmentation to improve real-time inference performance. The paper demonstrates significant reductions in model size (from 16.7MB to 2.1MB for CIFAR-10), FLOPs (from 65.82M to 61.01M), and parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy (94.15% top-1 on CIFAR-10). The architecture was successfully deployed on NXP BlueBox 2.0, an edge platform for autonomous vehicles, showing practical applicability for resource-constrained environments.\\narXiv ID: 2502.10047v1, Summary: This paper presents Janus, a novel framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer (ViT) inference over dynamic networks. The key innovation is combining token pruning techniques with a fine-to-coarse model splitting policy to enable efficient ViT execution across edge and cloud resources. Janus dynamically selects optimal pruning levels and split points based on network conditions, achieving up to 5.15x throughput improvement and reducing latency violations by up to 98.7% compared to baselines while maintaining accuracy. The system includes a lightweight profiler for latency prediction and a dynamic scheduler for real-time configuration. Experimental results demonstrate Janus\\'s effectiveness across image recognition and video classification tasks under various network conditions.\\narXiv ID: 2404.10407v1, Summary: This comprehensive survey paper evaluates four primary model compression techniques (quantization, low-rank approximation, knowledge distillation, and pruning) for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for edge deployment. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR datasets, the authors demonstrate that post-training quantization and knowledge distillation achieve the best trade-offs, reducing model size by 4x while maintaining accuracy. The paper also explores hybrid approaches, showing that combining quantization with knowledge distillation can double inference speed while reducing model size to 25% of original. Key findings include: 1) Dynamic quantization reduces ViT size to 84MB (from 327MB) with minimal accuracy drop (98.73% vs 98.94% on CIFAR-10), 2) DeiT tiny achieves 16.78 iterations/sec (vs 4.48 for vanilla ViT) with 95.43% accuracy, and 3) Hybrid approaches combining quantization and distillation achieve 2x speedup with manageable accuracy trade-offs.\\narXiv ID: 2303.08810v1, Summary: BiFormer introduces a novel bi-level routing attention (BRA) mechanism for vision transformers that enables dynamic, query-aware sparsity. BRA first filters irrelevant key-value pairs at a coarse region level (region-to-region routing) before applying fine-grained token-to-token attention in the remaining regions. This approach achieves O((HW)^(4/3)) complexity with proper region partitioning while maintaining global receptive fields. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet classification (83.8% top-1 accuracy for BiFormer-S), COCO object detection (47.1 mAP for BiFormer-B), and ADE20K semantic segmentation (49.9 mIoU for BiFormer-B). The method shows particular strength in preserving fine-grained details for small object detection, with BiFormer-S achieving 30.2 APs on COCO compared to 29.2 for WaveViT-S.\\narXiv ID: 2212.02687v3, Summary: This paper investigates dynamic inference techniques for vision transformers to enable efficient execution under varying resource constraints. Key findings include: (1) Convolutions dominate FLOPs in modern vision transformers (68-89%), not attention layers, due to integrated convolutions for accuracy/performance. (2) FLOP distribution poorly predicts GPU runtime due to optimized convolution execution. (3) Models show varying resilience to pruning - SegFormer achieves 28% energy savings with 1.4% accuracy drop without retraining, while ResNet-50 (via OFA) achieves 53% energy savings with 3.3% accuracy drop. The work provides insights for designing efficient vision transformers and dynamic execution strategies for edge deployment.\\narXiv ID: 2405.00906v1, Summary: LOTUS introduces a novel method combining data lottery ticket selection and sparsity pruning to accelerate vision transformer training while maintaining accuracy. The approach identifies informative data subsets and eliminates redundant parameters through a three-phase process: (1) attention-map-based data lottery ticket identification, (2) Instant Sparse Soup Pruning (ISSP) for model compression, and (3) fine-tuning. Experiments show rapid convergence (reaching near-SOTA performance by 5 epochs) and maintain 79% accuracy at 30% sparsity on CIFAR-10, though ISSP showed accuracy drops due to aggressive pruning. The work demonstrates promising directions for efficient transformer training through combined data and model optimization.\\narXiv ID: 2111.15667v3, Summary: This paper introduces Adaptive Token Sampler (ATS), a parameter-free module for dynamically reducing the number of tokens in vision transformers based on input content. ATS uses attention weights to score token importance and performs inverse transform sampling to select significant tokens. Key results: 1) Reduces DeiT-S GFLOPs by 37% with only 0.1% accuracy drop on ImageNet; 2) Achieves 2x computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy on Kinetics-400/600; 3) Can be added to pre-trained models without fine-tuning. The method shows superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs compared to DynamicViT and EViT.\\narXiv ID: 2408.08437v1, Summary: This paper presents PQV-Mobile, a combined pruning and quantization toolkit for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for mobile/edge deployment. Key contributions: 1) Supports multiple structured pruning methods (magnitude, Taylor, Hessian importance) and quantization (FP32 to FP16/int8); 2) Achieves 7.18x latency reduction with only 2.24% accuracy drop on DeiT models; 3) Provides hardware-aware optimizations for various backends (x86, FBGEMM, QNNPACK). Experimental results show superior latency-memory-accuracy tradeoffs compared to standalone compression methods.\\nCurrent Plan: Research Plan: "Adaptive Token-Head Co-Optimization for Edge ViTs" (ATHE)\\n\\n1.

Interaction 1:
```DIALOGUE
Let's start by brainstorming an innovative approach for edge-optimized image classification. Based on the literature, I notice most works focus on either model compression or dynamic inference, but few combine these with input-aware adaptation. What if we developed a "content-aware dynamic sparsification" technique for Vision Transformers that adjusts both model complexity and token processing based on input image characteristics? This could bridge the gap between static compression and fully dynamic approaches. What are your thoughts on this direction?
```
==================================================
Interaction 2:
```PLAN
Research Plan: "Adaptive Token-Head Co-Optimization for Edge ViTs" (ATHE)

1. Novel Technique: 
- Combines input-aware token pruning (ATS-like) with dynamic attention head routing
- Two-stage adaptation: (1) Lightweight CNN classifier categorizes input difficulty (simple/complex), (2) ViT dynamically adjusts:
   * Simple images: Aggressive token pruning (50-70%) + only basic attention heads
   * Complex images: Conservative pruning (20-30%) + all specialized heads

2. Implementation:
- Base Model: DeiT-Tiny (5.7M params) modified with:
   * Input classifier (MobileNetV1 0.25x width)
   * Token importance scoring (learned linear layer)
   * Head importance scoring (attention entropy-based)
- Device: Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) with PyTorch Lite
- Dataset: CIFAR-100 (resized to 224x224)

3. Experiment:
- Baseline Comparisons: 
   * Vanilla DeiT-Tiny
   * DynamicViT (token pruning only)
   * BiFormer (static sparse attention)
- Metrics:
   * Accuracy (top-1)
   * Latency (end-to-end inference)
   * Energy (measured via USB power monitor)
   * FLOPs reduction
- Evaluation Protocol:
   * 5 runs per configuration
   * Test on balanced subset (500 simple/complex images each)

4. Expected Innovations:
- First joint optimization of tokens and heads based on input content
- Hardware-friendly implementation (minimal overhead for adaptation logic)
- Demonstrable 2-3x latency reduction vs baselines for simple images

5. Timeline:
Week 1-2: Model modifications
Week 3: Baseline implementations
Week 4: Profiling/measurements
Week 5: Analysis/writeup
```
==================================================
Interaction 3:
```DIALOGUE
Let's analyze these initial results together. I notice both models achieved only 1% accuracy on the CIFAR-100 test subset, which is concerning. The latency measurements show our ATHE approach (4.24ms) is slightly faster than the base model (4.28ms), but the difference is minimal. 

Looking at the literature, we expected more significant improvements from dynamic token pruning (like ATS showed 37% FLOPs reduction with minimal accuracy drop). The poor accuracy suggests our simplified ViT implementation may be too minimal - perhaps we need:
1. More training data for the input classifier
2. Better token scoring mechanism
3. More transformer layers in the base model

The latency measurements are promising though - showing our adaptive approach doesn't add significant overhead. Let's discuss how we might improve this for the next iteration. What aspects would you prioritize fixing first?
```
==================================================
Interaction 4:
```INTERPRETATION
Our initial experiments reveal critical insights about the ATHE approach:

1. Performance Issues:
- Both models show 1% accuracy, indicating our simplified ViT fails to learn meaningful representations
- Latency difference is negligible (4.24ms vs 4.28ms) due to untrained components

2. Key Problems Identified:
- The single transformer layer lacks capacity for CIFAR-100 (vs 4+ layers in successful ViTs from literature)
- Untrained models make token pruning ineffective (compare to ATS's 37% FLOP reduction with trained models)
- Input classifier needs proper training to reliably categorize image difficulty

3. Positive Findings:
- Architectural overhead is minimal (0.04ms difference)
- Dynamic framework executes correctly, just needs better components

4. Recommended Improvements:
[Priority Order]
1. Train base ViT to ≥60% accuracy (add layers, proper training)
2. Implement attention-based token scoring (like ATS paper)
3. Add head routing mechanism
4. Include quantization (per PQV-Mobile results)

5. Literature Alignment:
Our approach can combine:
- ATS's dynamic token selection
- BiFormer's content-aware sparsity
- PQV-Mobile's quantization
To achieve better than state-of-the-art edge ViT performance

Next steps should focus on establishing a competent base model before optimizing the dynamic aspects.
